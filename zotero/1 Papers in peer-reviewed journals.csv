The anautogenous braconid Coeloides bostrichorum Giraud had a longer pre-oviposition period (5.1 vs. 3.3 days), a greater egg load (8.1 vs. 6.1 eggs), survived longer and emerged later than the pteromalid Rhopalicus tutela (Walker). In contrast, R. tutela was autogenous and tended to be more fecund under constrained conditions (9.7 vs. 5.1 total offspring per female). The longer pre-oviposition period of the specialist C. bostrichorum, coupled with its greater longevity, afforded the opportunity of better synchronization of ovipositing females with late instar larvae of I. typographus. By contrast, the polyphagous R. tutela matured rapidly, allowing parasitism of both younger and older larval instars of I. typographus in addition to other species. These small differences favoured the co-occurrence of the two parasitoid species on the same attacked trees.","2004","2018-01-19 09:45:23","2018-01-19 09:45:23","","341-347","","4","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Core","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the presence of C. bostrichorum, R. tutela behaved as a cleptoparasitoid, displacing the females from their oviposition sites and stealing the hosts previously located by the braconid.

However the real impact of this exotic species on native species was poorly investigated in the field. Because many ladybird species produce alkaloids as defensive compounds, we propose here a new method of intraguild predation monitoring in coccinellids based on alkaloid quantification by GC-MS. In laboratory experiments, adaline was unambiguously detected in fourth instar larvae of H. axyridis having ingested one egg or one first instar larva of Adalia bipunctata. Although prey alkaloids in the predator decreased with time, traces were still detected in pupae, exuviae and imagines of H. axyridis having ingested one prey when they were fourth instar larvae. Analysis of H. axyridis larvae collected in two potato fields shows for the first time in Europe the presence of exogenous alkaloids in 9 out of 28 individuals tested. This new method of intraguild predation detection could be used more widely to follow the interactions between predators and potential chemically defended insect preys.","2008-09-01","2018-01-19 09:44:57","2018-01-19 09:44:57","","191-196","","3","18","","Chemoecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also examined how environmental parameters (wind) and human activities (felling) could influence the beetles' flight. 3 The recapture percentage was higher in experiment 1 than in experiment 2: respectively, 7.0% (with 64 traps) and 2.3% (with 100 traps) of the beetles that took off were caught in the traps. 4 With the higher release rate (experiment 1), trap catches decreased with increased distance, whereas with the lower release rate (experiment 2), trap catches rose between 50 and 100 m then decreased with increasing distance. 5 Flight was little orientated by prevailing wind directions, a feature probably explained by the low wind speeds (0–1.2 m/s) observed throughout the study. 6 High trap catches of unmarked beetles close to areas undergoing thinning activities suggest that the presence of freshly cut spruce and larch material could have an influence on dispersal, attracting the beetles into the felling area.

Dose–response of the beetle was first examined in a trapping experiment in August 1999. The major pheromone components of I. typographus, (S)-cis-verbenol (cV) and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MB) were released from window traps. Five treatments were replicated five times: (1) blank trap, (2) 0.03 and 1.2, (3) 0.11 and 4.5, (4) 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and (5) Pheroprax. Trap catches increased linearly as a function of increasing release rates of cV and MB. A second study aimed at making preliminary observations on the attraction range of the pheromones as compared to Pheroprax. A release–recapture experiment was carried out in May 2000: four trap-trees located 50 m away from a central release platform were equipped with window traps baited with increasing release rates, tested in separate releases: 0.03 and 1.2; 0.11 and 4.5; 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and Pheroprax. Recaptures increased with the release rate. Trap catches were different at lower release rates, but not between the release rate of 15.2 mg/day of MB and Pheroprax. Variations in captures in relation to wind parameters showed persistently random flight at the lower release rates. Significant upwind flight was observed for Pheroprax only. These results imply that trap interference existed for Pheroprax and suggest that its attraction range may be greater than 50 m.","2001-12-01","2018-01-19 09:43:57","2018-01-19 09:43:57","","2425-2435","","12","27","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These new viruses, mostly of subtype H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8 belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, have been found in several Asian countries and have caused outbreaks in poultry in China, South Korea, and Vietnam. HPAI H5Nx also have spread over considerable distances with the introduction of viruses belonging to the same 2.3.4.4 clade in the U.S. (2014-2015) and in Europe (2014-2015 and 2016-2017). In this paper, we examine the emergence and spread of these new viruses in Asia in relation to published datasets on HPAI H5Nx distribution, movement of migratory waterfowl, avian influenza risk models, and land-use change analyses. More specifically, we show that between 2000 and 2015, vast areas of northeast China have been newly planted with rice paddy fields (3.21 million ha in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) in areas connected to other parts of Asia through migratory pathways of wild waterfowl. We hypothesize that recent land use changes in northeast China have affected the spatial distribution of wild waterfowl, their stopover areas, and the wild-domestic interface thereby altering transmission dynamics of avian influenza viruses across flyways. Detailed studies of the habitat use by wild migratory birds, of the extent of the wild-domestic interface, and of the circulation of avian influenza viruses in those new planted areas may help to shed more light on this hypothesis, and on the possible impact of those changes on the long-distance patterns of avian influenza transmission.","2017","2017-12-20 11:55:43","2017-12-20 11:55:43","2017-12-20 11:55:43","","","","4","","Front.

In this study, we aimed to quantify and compare the velocity of BTV epidemic that have affected different European countries under contrasted eco-climatic conditions and to relate these estimates to spatial factors such as temperature and host density. We used the thin plate spline regression interpolation method in combination with trend surface analysis to quantify the local velocity of different epidemics that have affected France (BTV-8 2007–2008, BTV-1 2008–2009), Italy (BTV-1 2014), Andalusia in Spain (BTV-1 2007) and the Balkans (BTV-4 2014).

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km 2 ). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations.","2016-03-15","2016-04-13 13:06:38","2016-04-13 13:06:38","2016-04-13 13:06:38","e0150424","","3","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/MKZMMVWR/Nicolas et al. - 2016 - Using Random Forest to Improve the Downscaling of .pdf","","map-people-livestock; mapping-livestock","Africa; Cattle; Chickens; Asia; Census; Farms; Livestock; Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","2011-12-01","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","196-205","","3","102","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza control along poultry market chains in South China","Special Issue: GEOVET 2010A Conference on the Application of Spatial Analytical Methods Used in Animal HealthGEOVET 2010","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/URQRDM47/Martin et al. - 2011 - Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza contro.pdf","","H5N1; KEY3","avian influenza; Poultry; HPAI H5N1; Risk assessment; Market chains; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.","2008-03-25","2015-09-23 09:00:49","2015-09-23 09:00:49","2015-09-23 09:00:49","4769-4774","","12","105","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 18362346","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/42G4TT4V/Gilbert et al. - 2008 - Mapping H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza ris.pdf","","H5N1; KEY4; livestock-diseases","Remote sensing; Epidemiology; animal husbandry; spatial modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Risk factors need to be identified to better understand disease ecology and assist HPAI surveillance and detection. This study analyzed the spatial distribution of HPAI outbreaks in relation to poultry, land use, and other anthropogenic variables from the start of the second epidemic wave (July 2004–May 2005). Results demonstrate a strong association between H5N1 virus in Thailand and abundance of free-grazing ducks and, to a lesser extent, native chickens, cocks, wetlands, and humans. Wetlands used for double-crop rice production, where free-grazing duck feed year round in rice paddies, appear to be a critical factor in HPAI persistence and spread. This finding could be important for other duck-producing regions in eastern and southeastern Asian countries affected by HPAI.","2006-02","2015-09-23 08:53:23","2015-09-23 08:53:23","2015-09-23 08:53:23","227-234","","2","12","","Emerg Infect Dis","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 16494747 PMCID: PMC3373083","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/WMMK4IJ4/Gilbert et al. - 2006 - Free-grazing Ducks and Highly Pathogenic Avian Inf.pdf","","H5N1; KEY4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most human cases have been attributable to poultry exposure at live-poultry markets, where most positive isolates were sampled. The potential geographic extent of potential re-emerging epidemics is unknown, as are the factors associated with it. Using newly assembled data sets of the locations of 8,943 live-poultry markets in China and maps of environmental correlates, we develop a statistical model that accurately predicts the risk of H7N9 market infection across Asia. Local density of live-poultry markets is the most important predictor of H7N9 infection risk in markets, underscoring their key role in the spatial epidemiology of H7N9, alongside other poultry, land cover and anthropogenic predictor variables. Identification of areas in Asia with high suitability for H7N9 infection enhances our capacity to target biosurveillance and control, helping to restrict the spread of this important disease.","2014-06-17","2015-09-22 14:32:06","2015-09-22 14:32:06","2015-09-22 14:32:06","4116","","","5","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/DQ83XWI5/Lambin et al. - 2010 - Pathogenic landscapes Interactions between land, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, in deriving populations at risk of disease estimates, these spatial models must rely on existing global and regional datasets on population distribution, which are often based on outdated and coarse resolution data. Moreover, a variety of different methods have been used to model population distribution at large spatial scales. In this review we describe the main global gridded population datasets that are freely available for health researchers and compare their construction methods, and highlight the uncertainties inherent in these population datasets. We review their application in past studies on disease risk and dynamics, and discuss how the choice of dataset can affect results. Moreover, we highlight how the lack of contemporary, detailed and reliable data on human population distribution in low income countries is proving a barrier to obtaining accurate large-scale estimates of population at risk and constructing reliable models of disease spread, and suggest research directions required to further reduce these barriers.","2012-03-20","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","7","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","En","2012 Linard and Tatem; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/RNENZPZT/Linard and Tatem - 2012 - Large-scale spatial population databases in infect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the recognition that urbanization influences the epidemiology of malaria, there is little consensus on urbanization relevant for malaria parasite mapping. Previous studies examining the relationship between urbanization and malaria transmission have used products defining urbanization at global/continental scales developed in the early 2000s, that overestimate actual urban extents while the population estimates are over 15 years old and estimated at administrative unit level.","2017","2017-02-09 13:17:57","2017-02-09 13:17:57","2017-02-09 13:17:57","49","","","16","","Malaria Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioMed Central","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/EC8UX7IF/Kabaria et al. - 2017 - The impact of urbanization and population density .pdf","","","Population Density; Urbanization; Malaria; Boosted regression trees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such temporal projections do not include any subnational variation in population distribution trends and ignore changes in geographical covariates such as urban land cover changes. Improved predictions of population distribution changes over time require the use of a limited number of covariates that are time-invariant or temporally explicit. Here we make use of recently released multi-temporal high-resolution global settlement layers, historical census data and latest developments in population distribution modelling methods to reconstruct population distribution changes over 30 years across the Kenyan Coast. We explore the methodological challenges associated with the production of gridded population distribution time-series in data-scarce countries and show that trade-offs have to be found between spatial and temporal resolutions when selecting the best modelling approach. Strategies used to fill data gaps may vary according to the local context and the objective of the study.

China is home to the largest population of chickens (4.83 billion) and ducks (0.694 billion), representing, respectively 23.1 and 58.6% of the 2013 world stock, with a significant part of poultry sold through live-poultry markets potentially contributing to the spread of avian influenza viruses. Previous models have looked at factors associated with HPAI H5N1 in poultry and LPAI H7N9 in markets. However, these have not been studied and compared with a consistent set of predictor variables. Significant progress was recently made in the collection of poultry census and live-poultry market data, which are key potential factors in the distribution of both diseases. Here we compiled and reprocessed a new set of poultry census data and used these to analyse HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 distributions with boosted regression trees models. We found a limited impact of the improved poultry layers compared to models based on previous poultry census data, and a positive and previously unreported association between HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and the density of live-poultry markets. In addition, the models fitted for the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 viruses predict a high risk of disease presence for the area around Shanghai and Hong Kong. The main difference in prediction between the two viruses concerned the suitability of HPAI H5N1 in north-China around the Yellow sea (outlined with Tianjin, Beijing, and Shenyang city) where LPAI H7N9 has not spread intensely.","2016-12-05","2016-12-31 10:38:07","2016-12-31 10:38:07","2016-12-31 10:38:07","1-10","","","","","Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess","H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza suitability models for China","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/N6MWSJZS/Artois et al. - 2016 - H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza suitability models f.pdf","","map-people-livestock; transmission-dynamics-h5n1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2006, an atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand. This study aimed to provide a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors. This should provide a basis for improving disease surveillance and control of PRRS in Thailand. RESULTS: Spatial scan statistics were used to detect clusters of outbreaks and allowed the identification of six spatial clusters covering 15 provinces of Thailand. Two modeling approaches were used to relate the presence or absence of PRRS outbreaks at the sub-district level to demographic characteristics of pig farming and other epidemiological spatial variables: autologistic multiple regressions and boosted regression trees (BRT). The variables showing a statistically significant association with PRRS presence in the autologistic multiple regression model were the sub-district human population and number of farms with breeding sows. The predictive power of the model, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots was moderate. BRT models had higher goodness of fit the metrics and identified the sub-district human population and density of farms with breeding sows as important predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country.","2014-08-05","2016-11-10 13:41:48","2016-11-10 13:41:48","","174","","","10","","BMC Vet.

We propose that even such successful advances are insufficient for many emergent diseases. We review work hypothesizing that Makona, phenotypically similar to much smaller outbreaks, emerged out of shifts in land use brought about by neoliberal economics. The epidemiological consequences demand a new science that explicitly addresses the foundational processes underlying multispecies health, including the deep-time histories, cultural infrastructure, and global economic geographies driving disease emergence. The approach, for instance, reverses the standard public health practice of segregating emergency responses and the structural context from which outbreaks originate. In Ebola's case, regional neoliberalism may affix the stochastic ""friction"" of ecological relationships imposed by the forest across populations, which, when above a threshold, keeps the virus from lining up transmission above replacement. Export-led logging, mining, and intensive agriculture may depress such functional noise, permitting novel spillovers larger forces of infection. Mature outbreaks, meanwhile, can continue to circulate even in the face of efficient vaccines. More research on these integral explanations is required, but the narrow albeit welcome success of the vaccine may be used to limit support of such a program.","2016","2016-11-09 20:27:03","2016-11-09 20:27:03","","149-165","","1","46","","Int J Health Serv","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26581892","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581892","","Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; ebola; Africa, Western; vaccine; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cultural Characteristics; Ebola Vaccines; ecological stochasticity; Forests; neoliberalism; Politics; Structural One Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of acclimation, infection with endosymbiotic bacteria and diet on the cold tolerance of the Mediterranean biocontrol population was assessed by determining the supercooling point, i. e. the temperature at which the insect's body fluids freeze. This parameter provides a first indication of an insect's establishment potential in a new region and of its possible geographical range. Allowing the predatory bugs to adapt to lower temperatures resulted in an increase in supercooling ability. Macrolophus pygmaeus bugs exposed to antibiotics in their artificial diet and hence cured from their infection with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis, Rickettsia bellii and R. limoniae were more tolerant to freezing than infected bugs. The diet of the predators also affected the freezing temperature of the body fluids. Predators fed an artificial diet based on egg yolk were less resistant to freezing than those fed Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs.

In a first step, a rearing system using eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as a food and synthetic polyester wadding as an oviposition substrate was compared with a natural rearing system using the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), as to its effects on the predator’s developmental and reproductive parameters. In a second series of experiments the performance of C. montrouzieri on bee pollen or on a mixture of E.kuehniella eggs and bee pollen was assessed. E. kuehniella eggs proved to be a suitable food to support larval development of the predator. Ladybird larvae reared on flour moth eggs developed two days faster and weighed approximately 10 % more than their counterparts reared on mealybugs. Despite a prolongation of the preoviposition period with ca. eight days and a decrease in egg hatch by about 10 %, C. montrouzieri females fed moth eggs accepted the synthetic wadding as an oviposition substrate and deposited the same number of eggs their counterparts maintained on mealybugs. A mixture of E. kuehniella eggs with pollen yielded similar developmental and reproductive rates as E. kuehniella eggs alone, but a diet of bee pollen alone was not adequate for the predator.

Such changes affect the dynamics of the interaction between major forest pest species, such as bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), and their host trees. Normally breeding mostly in broken or severely stressed spruce; at high population densities some bark beetle species can colonise and kill healthy trees on scales ranging from single trees in a stand to multi-annual landscape-wide outbreaks. In Eurasia, the largest outbreaks are caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (Linnaeus), which is common and shares a wide distribution with its main host, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.). A large literature is now available, from which this review aims to synthesize research relevant for the population dynamics of I. typographus and co-occurring species under changing conditions. We find that spruce bark beetle population dynamics tend to be metastable, but that mixed-species and age-heterogeneous forests with good site-matching tend to be less susceptible to large-scale outbreaks. While large accumulations of logs should be removed and/or debarked before the next swarming period, intensive removal of all coarse dead wood may be counterproductive, as it reduces the diversity of predators that in some areas may play a role in keeping I. typographus populations below the outbreak threshold, and sanitary logging frequently causes edge effects and root damage, reducing the resistance of remaining trees. It is very hard to predict the outcome of interspecific interactions due to invading beetle species or I. typographus establishing outside its current range, as they can be of varying sign and strength and may fluctuate depending on environmental factors and population phase. Most research indicates that beetle outbreaks will increase in frequency and magnitude as temperature, wind speed and precipitation variability increases, and that mitigating forestry practices should be adopted as soon as possible considering the time lags involved.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","34-51","","1","87","","","","","","","","","","other","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/92222/1/Kausrud%20et%20al%202011%20-%20Biological%20Reviews.pdf","Ips typographus; bark beetles; Forestry; Entomologie; Population dynamics; Climate change; Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Forest pests; Outbreak dynamics; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Zoologie forestierecynégétique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we compare the distribution (Belgium and Britain) and abundance (Belgium, Britain and Switzerland) of formerly common and widespread native ladybirds before and after the arrival of Harmonia axyridis, a globally rapidly expanding IAS. Location Europe Methods We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to assess the distribution trends of eight conspicuous and historically widespread and common species of ladybird within Belgium and Britain before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. The distribution data were collated largely through public participatory surveys but verified by a recognized expert. We also used GLMMs to model trends in the abundance of ladybirds using data collated through systematic surveys of deciduous trees in Belgium, Britain and Switzerland. Results Five (Belgium) and seven (Britain) of eight species studied show substantial declines attributable to the arrival of H. axyridis. Indeed, the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, declined by 30% (Belgium) and 44% (Britain) over 5years after the arrival of H. axyridis. Trends in ladybird abundance revealed similar patterns of declines across three countries. Main conclusion Together, these analyses show H. axyridis to be displacing native ladybirds with high niche overlap, probably through predation and competition. This finding provides strong evidence of a causal link between the arrival of an IAS and decline in native biodiversity.

Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy at the start of the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e.g. 1-30 days). Under both low (4°C after 5 days at 16°C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16°C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e.g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4°C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16°C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the oak processionary moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

However, most empirical support for this hypothesis comes from simple structured communities that are relatively easy to manipulate. The impact of forest biodiversity on forest ecosystem functioning has been far less studied. Experiment design - In this paper, we present the recently established, large-scale FORBIO experiment (FORest BIOdiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), specifically designed to test the effects of tree species diversity on forest ecosystem functioning. FORBIO's design matches with that of the few other tree diversity experiments worldwide, but at the same time, the FORBIO experiment is unique as it consists of a similar experimental set-up at three sites in Belgium (Zedelgem, Hechtel-Eksel and Gedinne) with contrasting edaphic and climatological characteristics. This design will help to provide answers to one of the most interesting unresolved questions in functional biodiversity research, notably whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning decrease in less stressful and more productive environments. At each site, FORBIO consists of 41 to 44 plots (127 plots in total) planted with monocultures and mixtures up to four species, selected from a pool of five site-adapted, functionally different tree species. When allocating the treatments to the plots, we maximally avoided any possible covariation between environmental factors. Monitoring of ecosystem functioning already started at the Zedelgem and Gedinne sites and will start soon in Hechtel-Eksel. Multiple processes are being measured and as the trees grow older, we plan to add even more processes. Expected results - Not only basic science, but also forest management will benefit from the results coming from the FORBIO experiment, as FORBIO is, for instance, also a test case for uncommon, not well-known tree species mixtures. To conclude, FORBIO is an important ecosystem experiment that has the potential to deliver badly needed insights into the multiple relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which will be valuable for both science and practice. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.","2013","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1-10","","1","146","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Ecologie; Sylviculture; Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research; Field experiment; Forest ecology; Forest management; Mixed forest; Tree diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the impact of such traits, we focused on two Eurasian spruce bark beetles that share a similar geographical distribution, but differ in their ecology and reproduction. Ips typographus is an aggressive tree-killing species characterized by strong dispersal, whereas Dendroctonus micans is a discrete inbreeding species (sib-mating is the rule), parasite of living trees and a poor disperser. We compared genetic variation between the two species over both beetles' entire range in Eurasia with five independent gene fragments, to evaluate whether their intrinsic differences could have an influence over their phylogeographic patterns. We highlighted widely divergent patterns of genetic variation for the two species, and argue that the difference is indeed largely compatible with their contrasting dispersal strategies and modes of reproduction. In addition, genetic structure in I. typographus divides European populations in a northern and a southern group, as was previously observed for its host plant, and suggests past allopatric divergence. A long divergence time was estimated between East Asian and other populations of both species, indicating their long-standing presence in Eurasia, prior to the last glacial maximum. Finally, the strong population structure observed in D. micans for the mitochondrial locus provides insights into the recent colonization history of this species, from its native European range to regions where it was recently introduced.

At endemic levels, these species are restricted to poorly defended resources, such as wind-felled, lightning-struck, or suppressed trees. It is poorly understood how these scattered and unpredictable resources are discovered and exploited. In this prospect, the collective foraging shown by most bark beetles, in the form of independent searching by individual beetles combined with mutual attention to each other's chemical signals, represents an efficient strategy to increase the probability to discover the resources. In order to explore the role of host distribution and collective foraging on the discovery of and settlement on wind-felled trees by bark beetles at endemic population densities, we developed a spatially explicit foraging model for the major forest pest in Europe, Ips typographus. The model is based on the diffusion of the beetles, the landing of pioneers on wind-felled trees realistically distributed based on field observations in southern Belgium, and the response of flying beetles to pheromones emitted by these pioneers. The results show that social foraging effectively increases the proportion of beetles that landed on wind-felled resources compared to solitary foragers. Furthermore, the model highlights the parameters that influenced the foraging strategy of I. typographus and that need narrower quantification in further experiments. Finally, in the frame of the tested parameters, the model highlights the existence of thresholds in the reproduction rate and in the size of the starting population under which populations collapse. If confirmed, this prediction would shed new light on the understanding of foraging at low, endemic population levels.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","188-199","","","337","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/236493/1/Elsevier_220120.pdf","Population dynamics; Forest pests; Collective behaviour; Technologie de l'environnement, contrôle de la pollution; Thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The longevity of these resources strongly influences population dynamics, but very little is known in this respect.We tested the hypothesis that the driving factor reducing the availability of fallen trees is the decrease of their nutritional quality. We analysed the qualitative changes of the phloem of spruces artificially uprooted at different times (2-17. month before the experiment started) and simultaneously exposed during the same flight season to attacks of the major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus. We also measured the impact of resources' decay on the insects' fecundity and the quality of their offspring.Our results show a surprisingly slow decrease of phloem quality over time. The beetles could develop on the oldest (17. month-old) resources with no significant differences in terms of fecundity, progeny body mass and global energy acquisition.Although they retain their nutritional quality over long periods, transient resources are exposed to other factors that make them rapidly unsuitable for I. typographus.

In the present study, we aimed to test this hypothesis further, by retrospective meteorological analyses and also by an experimental approach. 3 Our meteorological analyses highlighted the occurrence of cold waves a year before the beech declines were reported in 1929, 1942 and 1998. 4 In our experimental approach, frost injuries were inflicted to mature trees in a beech stand using dry ice. The treated trees were more attractive to insects than untreated controls. Insect attacks were observed in the treated zones on the trees but colonization was not very successful. The galleries had aborted most of the time with only a few larval chambers. Very few insects were caught in emergence traps. 5 The results of these two approaches support and strengthen the hypothesis that frost induced beech dieback. Frost injuries increased tree attraction to ambrosia beetles to the point of inducing attacks. However, the overall success of these attacks was much lower than that observed in the 2000s.

Many respondents also signified a lack of information about regulating services. Furthermore, provisioning services were perceived as equal in mixed species stands and monocultures, in contrast to higher productivity demonstrated in mixed species stands in the literature. The regional (Flanders and Wallonia) ecological and socio-economic context influenced both the perception of ecosystem services and of the importance of management objectives. Our results highlighted the need to address the lack of scientific data, to adapt communication to the ecological and socio-economic context, as well as to improve information flow on regulating services and productivity.","2014","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","639-653","","5","87","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/236847/3/Carnol_et_al_2014.pdf","Sylviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hosts face trade-offs in the allocation of resources in growth and reproduction or in defense, and the defense/resources status varies with time after host's death or weakening event. Tree-killing bark beetles at endemic levels must choose along a spectrum, compromising between encountering minimal defense and facing high competition, or benefiting from high nutritional quality but facing high host defense. The relationships between resources and defenses in dead/dying trees have not been quantitatively assessed to date, because most studies focus on epidemic conditions. We measured the changes in constitutive and induced defenses in the phloem of spruce trees artificially uprooted at different times (up to 17 months prior to experiment initiation) and treated with methyl-jasmonate (MeJ) in order to induce chemical defense. We measured the effect of these changes on different steps of the host selection process and brood success of a major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae).Our results show that uprooted trees maintain some level of constitutive defenses, in particular monoterpenes, that decrease with time after uprooting. Moreover, the trees maintain some inducibility and can produce monoterpenes in response to MeJ treatment up to 7 months after uprooting. These defenses are correlated in part with the energy available in the phloem, but are likely too weak to exert pressure on the beetles' success and selection, the latter being related to the amount of energy available. Our results confirm that wind-felled trees are poorly defended, consistent with the hypothesis of the evolution of the tree-killing behavior from saprophagy in response to an overwhelming interspecific competition on undefended hosts. Wind-felled trees still represent a useful resource, exposing endemic populations of aggressive beetles to low defense levels while facilitating reproduction, growth and development. The constraint on the beetles' populations then becomes the ability to locate these scattered and unpredictable resources.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","44-50","","","359","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/220668/1/Elsevier_204295.pdf","Ips typographus; Sylviculture; Bark beetle ecology; Droit de l'environnement; Economie de l'environnement et des ressources naturelles; Endemic populations; Environnement et pollution; Inducible defenses; Terpenes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, a decline of some native coccinellid species was observed in tree habitats. One hypothesis about the cause of this decline was that it might have been due to intraguild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis. In natural conditions, IGP between coccinellids can be tracked by using defensive compounds. Exogenous alkaloids in H. axyridis were therefore examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), using individuals sampled from lime trees that were also occupied by other species of coccinellids. Harmonia axyridis was the dominant species at all life stages, in terms of both numbers of sites occupied and local abundance. The GC–MS analysis of H. axyridis larvae revealed traces of exogenous alkaloids from 19 of the 20 sites and, in nine of those 19 sites, more than 30% of the larvae analyzed contained exogenous alkaloids. Three alkaloids were detected: adaline from Adalia spp., calvine from Calvia spp. and propyleine from Propylea quatuordecimpunctata. Predation by H. axyridis on two different coccinellid species was also detected in the same larva, reinforcing the status of H. axyridis as a top predator. A generalized linear model indicated that IGP frequency was positively influenced by two variables: the abundance of extraguild and intraguild prey; and the interaction between these two variables. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that IGP by H. axyridis on native coccinellids in tree habitats has led to the decline of several of these species.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1805-1814","","","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/98407/1/Hautier%20et%20al%202011%20Biol%20Invasions.pdf","Entomologie; Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Agronomie générale; Ecologie chimique; Alkaloids, Biological control, Biological invasions, Ladybirds, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the main assumptions is that enough susceptible adults mate with resistant insects. However, previous studies have suggested that the high toxin concentration produced by Bt plants induces slower insect development, creating an asynchrony in emergence between the refuge and the Bt zone and leading to assortative mating between adults inside each zone. Here, we develop a deterministic model to estimate the impact of toxin concentration, emergence asynchrony and refuge zone size on the effectiveness of the HD/R strategy. We conclude that emergence asynchrony only affects resistance when toxin concentration is high and resistance is recessive. Resistance develops more rapidly and survival of susceptible insects is higher at lower toxin concentration, but in such situations, resistance is insensitive to emergence asynchrony.","2012","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1323-1342","","11","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Entomologie; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Emergence asynchrony; HD/R strategy; Mutagenèse et technologie génétique; Population pest control; Random mating disruption; Resistance management; Toxin concentration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficiency of the HD/R strategy for both these Bt toxins. As the current two-toxin Bt plants do not express two new Cry toxins but reuse one toxin already in use with a one-toxin plant, we estimated the spread of resistance when the resistance alleles are not rare. This study assesses: (i) whether the two toxins have to be present in high concentration, and (ii) the impact of the relative size of the refuge zone on the evolution of resistance and population density.

For many insects, reproductive success in patchily-distributed species can be improved by sibling-mating. Inmany cases, such strategies correspond to sexual dimorphism, with males–whose reproductive activities can take place withoutdispersal–investing less energy in development of dispersive resources such as large body size and wings. This dimorphism isparticularly likely when males have little or no chance of mating outside their place of birth, such as when sperm competitionprecludes successful fertilisation in females that have already mated. The economically important bark beetle pest speciesDendroctonus micans (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) has been considered to be exclusively sibling-mating, with 90% offemales having already mated with their brothers by emergence. The species does not, however, show strong sexualdimorphism; males closely resemble females, and have been observed flying through forests. We hypothesised that this lack ofsexual dimorphism indicates that male D. micans are able to mate with unrelated females, and to sire some or all of theiroffspring, permitting extrafamilial reproduction. Using novel microsatellite markers, we carried out cross-breeding laboratoryexperiments and conducted paternity analyses of resulting offspring. Our results demonstrate that a second mating with a lessrelatedmale can indeed lead to some offspring being sired by the latecomer, but that most are sired by the first, sibling male.We discuss these findings in the context of sperm competition versus possible outbreeding depression.","2014","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","327-333","","","113","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/148343/10/x.pdf","Entomologie; Ecologie [animale]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid introduction of harmful organisms through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that <1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the inspection increased with lot size, but the probability that the infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0.95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0.6 in the other countries.

Information about the structure of plant trade networks is not generally available, but it is valuable for better assessing the potential risks associated with the trade in live plants and the development of prevention and mitigation measures and policy. The discovery of two larvae of Anoplophora chinensis (citrus longhorn beetle - CLB) in 2009, at a nursery importing Acer palmatum from China in one of the major Dutch tree nursery areas, has resulted in the creation of a detailed dataset on the intra- European Union trade in its potential hosts. This study describes European imports of the primary host of A. chinensis, Acer spp., into the Netherlands (1998-2012) and the effects of the finding in a tree nursery area. In addition, shipments of Acer spp. from 138 producers in the nursery area in 2009 were analysed in a one-offanalysis of intra-EU trade. The volume of Acer spp. imports from Asia was stable early during the studied period, and declined to 5% of the initial imports after a period of interceptions, illustrating the effect of regulations. The number of notifications of A. chinensis infestations in imported consignments of Acer spp. increased sharply in the years up to 2007, then declined as imports also reduced. Although plants were shipped to destinations throughout Europe, each producer shipped plants only to few destinations in few countries. Most of the plants were shipped to nurseries in EU countries. These patterns could make it easier to target these high risk destinations for control measures. The lack of transaction records makes it difficult to trace the destination of plants. More systematic electronic record keeping by traders and growers and the data being collated in a database that can be made available to regulatory authorities, together with further studies of plant trade data using network approaches, would be beneficial for improving trace-back and trace-forward and provide better safeguards for plant health and quality.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1-20","","","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/242985/3/Eschen_et_al_2015_Neobiota.pdf","Généralités; international trade; Citrus longhorn beetle (Anoplophora chinensis Forster); Invasive alien insects; Japanese maple (Acer palmatum Thunb.); Plants for planting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the ISEFOR database, this paper describes the diversity and dynamics of P4P imports into the EU, based on genus-level data for lots imported into fourteen Member States that provided this data for different periods between 2005 and 2014, totalling over 30Bn plants and over 7500 commodities. There was great variety, as well as complementarity, in terms of the imported genera, origins and commodities among the countries. Two-thirds of the imported commodities changed every year. Based on the 10-year data from the Netherlands, the greatest importer of live plants in the dataset, we developed a risk categorisation approach for prioritising the highest risk commodities, based on risk associated information concerning the imported genus and the history of trade with respect to the exporting countries, genera and type of plant material traded. Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive phytosanitary inspections.","2017-06-07","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-10 05:00:16","1-15","","","","","Biol Invasions","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-017-1465-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The specificity of R. grandis relies on kairomones which female predators use to adjust their oviposition to the number of prey larvae available in a gallery. Yet these chemical signals are still largely unknown. The North American D. punctatus and D. valens, which are not sympatric with R. grandis but have a similar ecology as D. micans, could also elicit predator oviposition, which would suggest that specificity in this predator-prey system is constrained by geography. In order to further identify these determinants of specificity, we used artificial oviposition boxes to compare the oviposition level of R. grandis in the presence of larvae of each of the three prey species. We jointly used sequential dynamic headspace extractions and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate oviposition stimuli associated with each prey species and potential oviposition inhibitors emitted by the predator. We further assessed potential stimuli with the analysis of emissions from D. micans larvae reared alone. Overall, we identified and quantified 67 compounds, mostly terpenes. Several robust candidate stimulants or inhibitors of R. grandis’ oviposition were identified. The three prey species elicited similar oviposition levels in R. grandis, which suggests that this predator could form new associations outside of its native range.","2017-08-01","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","778-793","","8","43","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. 2.We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. 3.Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographic range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections, and the cost of high resolution data. 4.Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.

As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.","2018-07-18","2018-07-20 08:01:40","2018-07-20 08:01:40","2018-07-20 08:01:40","e0199547","","7","13","","PLOS ONE","Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in Mauritania","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/WS8BDPIW/Nicolas et al. - 2018 - Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in.pdf; /Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/RGKMM87W/article.html","","","Veterinary diseases; Camels; Cattle; Sheep; Livestock; Centrality; Mauritania; Ruminants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth&rsquo;s surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.","2018-07-20","2018-07-20 07:50:24","2018-07-20 07:50:24","2018-07-20 07:50:24","1145","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/MF7GBYZV/Forget et al. - 2018 - Supervised Classification of Built-Up Areas in Sub.pdf; /Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/CVPNUWZB/1145.html","","","built-up detection; landsat; openstreetmap; urban remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters of HPAI A (H5N1) virus emerged, leading to an important number of AI A (H5N1) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date, few studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A (H5N1) outbreaks in Egypt in relation to protective / risk factors at the farm level, a gap we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production, as a basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A (H5N1) presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta. Results: The probability of HPAI A (H5N1) presence was associated with several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status, absence of windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of production were found to be protective factors, whereas the presence of a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the village was found to be a risk factor. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A (H5N1) virus circulation, which could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt.","2018-12","2018-06-22 08:59:28","2018-06-22 08:59:29","2018-06-22 08:59:28","","","1","14","","","Avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks in different poultry farm types in Egypt","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/MZXH52US/Artois et al. - 2018 - Avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks in different po.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of zoonoses emerging from livestock, one of the most significant changes that has taken place since the mid twentieth century is what has been termed the “livestock revolution”, whereby the stock of food animals, their productivity and their trade has increased rapidly to feed rising and increasingly wealthy and urbanized populations. Further increases are projected in the future in low and middle-income countries. Using avian influenza as an example, we discuss how the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 in China was linked to rapid intensification of the poultry sector taking place in landscapes rich in wetland agriculture and wild waterfowls habitats, providing an extensive interface with the wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Trade networks and live-poultry markets further exacerbated the spread and persistence of avian influenza as well as human exposure. However, as the history of emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) demonstrates in high-income countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, this is by no way specific to low and middle-income countries. Many HPAI emergence events took place in countries with generally good biosecurity standards, and the majority of these in regions hosting intensive poultry production systems. Emerging zoonoses are only one of a number of externalities of intensive livestock production systems, alongside antimicrobial consumption, disruption of nutrient cycles and greenhouse gases emissions, with direct or indirect impacts on human health. In parallel, livestock production is essential to nutrition and livelihoods in many low-income countries. Deindustrialization of the most intensive production systems in high-income countries and sustainable intensifications in low-income countries may converge to a situation where the nutritional and livelihood benefits of livestock production would be less overshadowed by its negative impacts on human an ecosystem health.","2017-11-27","2018-01-19 10:16:26","2018-04-16 08:49:35","2018-01-19 10:16:26","48","","","75","","Arch Public Health","Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29209498 PMCID: PMC5702979","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/2CBQDDZE/Gilbert et al. - 2017 - Intensifying poultry production systems and the em.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702979/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A central question is to determine regions that are likely sources of newly emerging influenza strains with pandemic causing potential. A suitable candidate is Bangladesh, being one of the most densely populated countries in the world and having an intensifying farming system. It is therefore vital to establish the key factors, specific to Bangladesh, that enable both continued transmission within poultry and spillover across the human–animal interface. We apply a modelling framework to H5N1 epidemics in the Dhaka region of Bangladesh, occurring from 2007 onwards, that resulted in large outbreaks in the poultry sector and a limited number of confirmed human cases. This model consisted of separate poultry transmission and zoonotic transmission components. Utilising poultry farm spatial and population information a set of competing nested models of varying complexity were fitted to the observed case data, with parameter inference carried out using Bayesian methodology and goodness-of-fit verified by stochastic simulations. For the poultry transmission component, successfully identifying a model of minimal complexity, which enabled the accurate prediction of the size and spatial distribution of cases in H5N1 outbreaks, was found to be dependent on the administration level being analysed. A consistent outcome of non-optimal reporting of infected premises materialised in each poultry epidemic of interest, though across the outbreaks analysed there were substantial differences in the estimated transmission parameters. The zoonotic transmission component found the main contributor to spillover transmission of H5N1 in Bangladesh was found to differ from one poultry epidemic to another. We conclude by discussing possible explanations for these discrepancies in transmission behaviour between epidemics, such as changes in surveillance sensitivity and biosecurity practices.","2017","2017-04-03 14:45:52","2018-04-16 08:48:39","2017-04-03 14:45:52","37-55","","","20","","Epidemics","Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/NCD6S8V4/Hill et al. - Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales.pdf","","","Mathematical modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data collected through active surveillance of Vietnamese live-bird markets (LBMs) between 2011 and 2015 were used to explore and compare the spatio-temporal distributions of H5N1- and H5N6-positive LBMs. Conditional autoregressive models were developed to quantify spatio-temporal associations between agro-ecological factors and the two HPAI strains using the same set of predictor variables. Unlike H5N1, which exhibited a strong north-south divide, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces, H5N6 was homogeneously distributed throughout Vietnam. Similarly, different agro-ecological factors were associated with each strain. Sample collection in the months of January and February and higher average maximum temperature were associated with higher likelihood of H5N1 positive market-day status. The likelihood of market-days being positive for H5N6 increased with decreased river density, and with successive Rounds of data collection.

The model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated over Albania based observed eggs abundance data weekly monitored during three years. For a given week of the year, eggs abundance was mainly predicted by the number of eggs and the mean temperature recorded in the preceding weeks. That is, results are in agreement with the biological cycle of the mosquito, reflecting the effect temperature on eggs spawning, maturation and hatching. The model, seeded by initial egg values derived from a second model, was then used to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of eggs abundance over the selected Balkan countries, weekly in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Following its introduction in Portugal in the late 1990s, extensive monitoring programs for PWN and its vectors have been conducted throughout the European Union, using locally developed and tested lures and traps. The trapping system developed in Europe and used in this study is composed of a Crosstrap® and Galloprotect Pack® lures. These trapping systems were deployed in two locations in the USA, two locations in Canada, and one location in China in order to test their capacity to detect Monochamus species exotic to Europe. Large numbers of M. carolinensis, M. mutator, M. notatus, M. s. scutellatus, M. clamator, and M. titillator were trapped in North America, while large numbers of M. alternatus were trapped in China. The trapping systems developed in Europe for monitoring the European Monochamus species are also effective for the detection of many exotic Monochamus species and could thus be used as an early detection tool in ports and other high-risk sites.","2018-02-01","2018-02-08 12:19:42","2018-02-08 12:19:42","","","","","","","Journal of Pest Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These mobility patterns are different in terms of animals involved (fewer cattle and dromedaries are traded around Tabaski), the means of transportation (the volume of animals moved by truck raises around Tabaski) and destinations (most of the animals are traded nationally around Tabaski).

The draft method has been tested on pests of concern to the European Union (EU). The method is adaptable and can focus either on all the steps and sub-steps of the assessment process or on specific parts if necessary. It is based on assessing changes in pest population abundance as the major driver of the impact on cultivated plants and on the environment. Like other pest risk assessment systems the method asks questions about the likelihood and magnitude of factors that contribute to risk. Responses can be based on data or expert judgment. Crucially, the approach is quantitative, and it captures uncertainty through the provision by risk assessors of quantile estimates of the probability distributions for the assessed variables and parameters. The assessment is based on comparisons between different scenarios, and the method integrates risk-reducing options where they apply to a scenario, for example current regulation against a scenario where risk-reducing options are not applied. A strategy has been developed to communicate the results of the risk assessment in a clear, comparable and transparent way, with the aim of providing the requestor of the risk assessment with a useful answer to the question(s) posed to the EFSA Plant Health Panel. The method has been applied to four case studies, two fungi, Ceratocystis platani and Cryphonectria parasitica, the nematode Ditylenchus destructor and the Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma.

Here we suggest that, in addition to many other traits, the dorsal spines of its larvae contribute to their success, as suggested by behavioural observations of agonistic interactions between H. axyridis and European coccinellids. In coccinellids, the role of dorsal spines in these interactions has been poorly studied and they could be a physical protection against intraguild predators. Dorsal spines of second instar H. axyridis larvae were removed with micro-scissors, which resulted in spineless larvae after moulting (spineless group). These larvae were then exposed to starved Coccinella septempunctata larvae. Two control categories were also submitted to interactions: H. axyridis larvae with all their spines (control group) and with their spines, but injured by pin stings (injured group). Spine removal at the second instar did not hamper H. axyridis development. The bite rate by C. septempunctata was significantly higher on the spineless H. axyridis and more dorsally located compared to the control and injured groups, while no bite rate difference was observed between the injured and the control group. Our results suggest that in addition to behavioural and chemical defenses, the dorsal spines play a significant protective role against bites. Therefore, spines in ladybirds could be considered as a morphological defense against intraguild predation. In H. axyridis, these defenses might contribute to its success in food resources already exploited by other guild members and thus further facilitate the invasion of new areas.","2017","2018-01-19 13:21:03","2018-01-19 13:21:03","2018-01-19 13:21:03","","","","5","","Front.

When a male beetle finds a suitable host, it releases pheromones that attract potential mates as well as other ‘spying’ males, which result in aggregations on the new host. To date, most studies have been concerned with the use of aggregation pheromones by bark beetles to overcome the defences of living, well-protected trees. How insects behave when facing undefended or poorly defended hosts remains largely unknown. The spatio-temporal pattern of resource colonization by the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, was quantified when weakly defended hosts (fallen trees) were attacked. In many of the replicates, colonization began with the insects rapidly scattering over the available surface and then randomly filling the gaps until a regular distribution was established, which resulted in a constant decrease in nearest-neighbour distances to a minimum below which attacks were not initiated. The scattered distribution of the first attacks suggested that the trees were only weakly defended. A minimal theoretical distance of 2.5 cm to the earlier settlers (corresponding to a density of 3.13 attacks dm−2) was calculated, but the attack density always remained lower, between 0.4 and 1.2 holes dm−2, according to our observations.","2018-01-01","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","170454","","1","5","","","Colonization of weakened trees by mass-attacking bark beetles","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

We gradually replaced polyethylene-bag verbenone dispensers by composite dispensers releasing verbenone and non-host volatiles (NHV: green leaf volatiles, trans-conophthorin, and C8-alcohols). Many experiments did not give statistically significant results, due to the low number of true replicates and the spatial heterogeneity of beetle attacks. The protection of horizontal objects like logs or lying trees with anti-attractants was not always successful. In the future, positive results can be expected with an area covering spray applied by zeolite dispensers containing mixtures of verbenone and NHV. A similar approach could probably be used in aerial spraying of anti-attractants. We have succeeded in our attempt to protect zones of standing spruce trees from I. typographus attacks. We used dispensers with a combination of verbenone and a full blend of NHV compounds.

Its monospecific predator Rhizophagus grandis has followed its prey naturally into most areas and since the 1960s has also been mass-produced and released within newly infested locations. Assessing bark-beetle presence at previously uninfested sites, or predator establishment after release or natural spread, currently depends on direct observation of D. micans brood chambers. This is a slow and unreliable process because bark-beetle attacks are solitary, cryptic and occur on living trees. An effective trapping method would thus be most useful. * 2A synthetic lure for R. grandis was first field-tested in release–recapture experiments. Release points were surrounded by one or two concentric rings of traps baited with either D. micans larval frass or with a blend of synthetic chemicals. Kairomone-trapping using the synthetic lure was then tested in the field, monitoring R. grandis in 58 spruce stands in Belgium and France. * 3In the release–recapture experiments, up to 65% of the released predators were caught within 48 h. Catches with the synthetic lure and with prey frass were not significantly different. * 4Field-trapping assays showed R. grandis establishment in 30 stands, including areas where the predator had been introduced artificially. Trapping was unsuccessful at the southern and western limits of D. micans’ range. Combined visual and trapping approaches identified 32 stands containing the predators, with two false negatives with the trapping method, compared to 19 for the visual surveys. * 5Unexpectedly, male and female D. micans adults were trapped in some cases. The combined approach identified 43 attacked stands, among which there were four false negatives with the trapping method and 11 with the visual surveys. * 6Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of using kairomone traps to monitor a predator after releases for biocontrol. Furthermore, because this predator is strictly prey-specific, this technique also identifies stands colonized by D. micans bark beetles. Following inoculative predator releases, kairomone trapping could be used to survey for D. micans in areas under colonization or in European Union ‘Protected Zones’.","2008-04-01","2018-01-19 09:46:00","2018-01-19 09:46:00","","537-548","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","biological control; pheromones; beetles trapping; invasive pests monitoring; lures; oxygenated monoterpenes; predator–prey relationship; semiochemicals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large epidemic in 2016–17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016–17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of Feb 23, 2017, from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Between Feb 19, 2013, and Feb 23, 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013–14, 219 in 2014–15, 114 in 2015–16, and 447 in 2016–17. The 2016–17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41% (55 of 134) to 57% (254 of 447) from the first epidemic to the 2016–17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 epidemics (63% [72 of 114] and 61% [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the first three epidemics (39% [52 of 134], 55% [169 of 306], and 56% [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016–17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Age distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially.

Domestic and wild vertebrates are asymptomatic reservoirs for the virus, putting animal handlers, slaughter-house workers and agricultural labourers at highest risk in endemic areas, with secondary transmission possible through contact with infected blood and other bodily fluids. Human infection is characterized by severe symptoms that often result in death. While it is known that CCHFV transmission is limited to Africa, Asia and Europe, definitive global extents and risk patterns within these limits have not been well described. Methods We used an exhaustive database of human CCHF occurrence records and a niche modeling framework to map the global distribution of risk for human CCHF occurrence. Results A greater proportion of shrub or grass land cover was the most important contributor to our model, which predicts highest levels of risk around the Black Sea, Turkey, and some parts of central Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa shows more focalized areas of risk throughout the Sahel and the Cape region. Conclusions These new risk maps provide a valuable starting point for understanding the zoonotic niche of CCHF, its extent and the risk it poses to humans.","2015-08","2018-10-05 06:39:49","2018-10-05 06:39:49","2018-10-05 06:39:49","503-513","","8","109","","Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26142451 PMCID: PMC4501401","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/Y7AYPWW3/Messina et al. - 2015 - The global distribution of Crimean-Congo hemorrhag.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501401/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.","2018-09-13","2018-10-10 09:27:23","2018-10-10 09:27:23","2018-10-10 09:27:23","e1006439","","9","14","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","","Poultry; H5N1; Bangladesh; Epidemiology; Livestock; Infectious disease control; Infectious disease surveillance; Vaccination and immunization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GLW 3 provides global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in each land pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approximately 10 km at the equator). They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.","2018-10-30","2018-11-27 15:31:03","2018-11-27 15:31:03","2018-11-27 15:31:03","180227","","","5","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/SHZ6W3X2/Gilbert et al. - 2018 - Global distribution data for cattle, buffaloes, ho.pdf; /Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/WMCNPAXR/sdata2018227.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 17 years of genomic and epidemiological data, we reconstruct the recent dispersal history of RABV in domestic dogs in Yunnan, a rural province of China, and estimate RABV transmission rate between dogs and from dogs to humans. Using a phylogeographic approach, we also evaluated the potential impact of several environmental factors on the mode and tempo of virus lineage dispersal. Our findings have implications for rabies prevention and control in Asian countries.","2018","2018-12-07 09:34:28","2018-12-07 09:34:28","","e1007392","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
