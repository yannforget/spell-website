ASFV originates from sub-Saharan African countries. In the last 10 years, the virus left its endemic range to spread to eastern Europe and Russia. On September 2018, Belgian authorities reported that ASFV had been detected in two wild boars in a southern area of the country. One year later, no domestic pig has been infected, with the last ASFV-positive wild boar being confirmed in mid-August 2019, suggesting that the outbreak is now controlled. However, the dispersal dynamics as well as the specific impact of ecological factors and intervention measures on the outbreak remain unknown. In total, 827 positive cases have been reported in wild boar populations. In this study, we exploit the resulting spatio-temporal distribution of occurrence data to investigate the wavefront progression. We first present the application of recently developed methods to quantify the local wavefront velocity of an invading epidemic. Second, we develop and apply a novel analytical framework that uses occurrence data to investigate the impact of ecological factors on the dispersal dynamics of a wavefront progression. Our analyses highlighted that the network of barriers, involving installed fences, had an impact on both the effective dispersal and the wavefront dispersal velocity. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the wavefront progression was slower outside forest areas. Together, these results have concrete implications for potential future ASFV epidemics in similar regions. Synthesis and applications. We describe a novel analytical approach that exploits occurrence data to investigate the impact of ecological factors on the wavefront velocity and actual wavefront progression. This methodology has the potential to be quickly applied to outbreak datasets solely made of occurrence data, with key benefits for the epidemiological investigations of external spatial factors impacting pathogen dispersal across non-endemic areas. Our analytical workflow could also be further applied to investigate the impact of ecological factors on any kind of biological dispersions (pathogen spreads, invasive species).","2020","2020-09-03 10:30:13","2020-11-15 12:04:46","2020-09-03 10:29:36","1619-1629","","8","57","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 British Ecological Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13649","","","","modelling-invasions","African swine fever; biological invasion; dispersal dynamics; ecological factors; outbreak; virus; wavefront progression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reconstructing transmission chains remains a challenging endeavour, except in rare cases characterized by intense surveillance and epidemiological inquiry. Inference frameworks attempt to estimate or approximate these transmission chains but the accuracy and validity of such methods generally lack formal assessment on datasets for which the actual transmission chain was observed. We here introduce nosoi, an open-source r package that offers a complete, tunable and expandable agent-based framework to simulate transmission chains under a wide range of epidemiological scenarios for single-host and dual-host epidemics. nosoi is accessible through GitHub and CRAN, and is accompanied by extensive documentation, providing help and practical examples to assist users in setting up their own simulations. Once infected, each host or agent can undergo a series of events during each time step, such as moving (between locations) or transmitting the infection, all of these being driven by user-specified rules or data, such as travel patterns between locations. nosoi is able to generate a multitude of epidemic scenarios, that can—for example—be used to validate a wide range of reconstruction methods, including epidemic modelling and phylodynamic analyses. nosoi also offers a comprehensive framework to leverage empirically acquired data, allowing the user to explore how variations in parameters can affect epidemic potential. Aside from research questions, nosoi can provide lecturers with a complete teaching tool to offer students a hands-on exploration of the dynamics of epidemiological processes and the factors that impact it. Because the package does not rely on mathematical formalism but uses a more intuitive algorithmic approach, even extensive changes of the entire model can be easily and quickly implemented.","2020","2020-09-03 10:12:27","2021-06-29 08:08:55","2020-09-03 10:11:44","1002-1007","","8","11","","Methods Ecol.

São Paulo is the most densely populated state in southeast Brazil. The outbreak has caused serious public health concern in the state, as YFV does not normally circulate widely there and most of the 21 million inhabitants were correspondingly unvaccinated against YFV when the outbreak began. In Brazil, YFV typically circulates among non-human primates (NHPs), and human cases represent isolated spill over events from this predominantly sylvatic cycle. Understanding the epidemiological dynamics and spread of YFV in NHPs is therefore critical for contextualising human cases, and guiding vaccination strategies that can better protect local human populations. Here, we aim to contextualise human cases, identify epizootic foci and uncover the rate and direction of YFV spread in São Paulo. We analyse the geographic and temporal distribution of observed cases of YFV in NHPs in São Paulo state, and identify three distinct phases of the epizootic. We generate virus genome sequences from 51 YFV-positive cases and perform phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses aimed at understanding the spatial spread of YFV in São Paulo state. Analyses of these data indicate that YFV spread from the north of São Paulo state into more densely populated southern regions. Although we observe substantial heterogeneity in the rate at which different sampled YFV lineages spread, the typical rate of spread was low with a mean rate of ~1 km per day. This is consistent with a scenario in which the majority of transmission events occurred between NHPs primates and sylvatic vectors across forested patches.","2020-08-07","2020-08-11 10:20:01","2021-01-30 15:47:23","","e1008699","","8","16","","PLoS Path.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset identified >100 international virus introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76%) of the Brazilian strains fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February11 March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread mostly locally and within-state borders. After this period, despite sharp decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban centers that coincided with a 25% increase in average travelled distances in national flights.

Using statistical mapping techniques, we correlated the occurrence of human rabies to environmental (elevation, precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], temperature, and distance to the nearest main rivers) and anthropogenic (human and dog population density, distance to the nearest main roads, and gross domestic product [GDP]) factors. We used a performance score, the average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (0.88), to validate our risk model. Using this model, we found that environmental factors were more strongly associated with human rabies occurrence than anthropogenic factors.

Here, we analyse 346 novel pol sequences from the DRC to compare the evolutionary dynamics of the main HIV-1 lineages, subtypes A1, C and D. Our results place the origins of subtype C in the 1950s in Mbuji-Mayi, the mining city of southern DRC, while subtypes A1 and D emerged in the capital city of Kinshasa, and subtypes H and J in the less accessible port city of Matadi. Following a 15-year period of local transmission in southern DRC, we find that subtype C spread at least three-fold faster than other subtypes circulating in Central and East Africa. In conclusion, our results shed light on the origins of HIV-1 main lineages and suggest that socio-historical rather than evolutionary factors may have determined the epidemiological fate of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa.","2019","2020-05-08 09:33:11","2020-05-08 09:33:11","2020-05-08 09:32:15","e1007976","","12","15","","PLoS Pathogens","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Africa; Phylogeography; Phylogenetics; Phylogenetic analysis; HIV-1; Sequence analysis; HIV epidemiology; Uganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these genetic variability patterns are often considered after issues are observed, long after the beginning of production. By taking into account lessons from other species, we investigate the genetic variability of Perca fluviatilis, a species at a nascent stage of production. The genetic variability has been previously studied but, due to discrepancies between conclusions and methodological limits, the spatial distribution of genetic variability in P. fluviatilis has not been demonstrated conclusively. Here, we characterise the genetic variability across 84 West-Palaearctic sampling sites using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. We aim to provide (i) a genetically-based population structure that could act as an impetus for further production improvement and (ii) guidelines for translocation regulations. Our analyses show an uneven distribution of genetic variability. Based on inter-populational genetic differentiation, we identify five large geographic scale clusters which are further divided into several subgroups. Local genetic diversity mapping highlights a spatial pattern with several hotspots, which has serious implications in the development of appropriate regulations of translocations.

Concerns have been expressed within the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) about recent introductions of non-indigenous species of these groups. Regulation of the non-coniferous wood trade into many EPPO member countries is currently not sufficient to cover such risks. In 2018&ndash;2019, an EPPO study on the risk of bark and ambrosia beetles associated with imported non-coniferous wood was carried out, and the key characteristics contributing to the pest risk from introduced species were determined using expert consensus. This paper summarizes the key findings of the study, which are available in full detail on the EPPO website. The study identified biological and other risk factors and illustrated them with examples from 26 beetle species or groups of species known to be invasive or posing a threat to plant health. These representative species were classified into three categories based on known damage and level of uncertainty. In the present article, factorial discriminant analyses were used to identify features of bark and ambrosia beetle biology associated with damage caused and invasiveness. Based on the information assembled and consideration of the risk factors, it was recommended that in order to prevent the introduction of new bark and ambrosia beetles via non-coniferous wood commodities, horizontal phytosanitary measures should be adopted, irrespective of the host plant species and the origin (i.e., for all genera of non-coniferous woody plants and from all origins). Phytosanitary measures are presented here for various wood commodities.","2020","2020-03-19 15:01:03","2021-06-29 08:08:40","","","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","invasive species; biosecurity; pest risk; plant health; Platypodinae; quarantine; Scolytinae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aggregated chicken and duck fine-resolution census in Thailand, using three administrative census levels in regular and irregular shapes. We then disaggregated the data within the Gridded Livestock of the World analytical framework, sampling predictors in two different ways. A sensitivity analysis on Pearson’s r correlation statistics and RMSE was carried out to understand how size and shapes of the response variables affect the goodness-of-fit and downscaling performances. We showed that scale, rather than shapes and sampling methods, affected downscaling precision, suggesting that training the model using the finest administrative level available is preferable. Moreover, datasets showing non-homogeneous distribution but instead spatial clustering seemed less affected by MAUP, yielding higher Pearson’s r values and lower RMSE compared to a more spatially homogenous dataset. Implementing aggregation sensitivity analysis in spatial studies could help to interpret complex results and disseminate robust products.","2020-01-27","2020-02-21 19:45:41","2021-06-29 07:34:01","2020-02-21 19:45:41","e0221070","","1","15","","PLoS One","Downscaling livestock census data using multivariate predictive models","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","","Poultry; Census; Chicken models; Chickens; Ducks; Livestock; Modifiable areal unit problem; Polygons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phylogeographic studies have placed the introduction of subtype B in the United States in New York around 1970, where it grew into a major source of spread. Currently, it is estimated that over one million people are living with HIV in the US and that most are infected with subtype B variants. Here, we aim to identify the drivers of HIV-1 subtype B dispersal in the United States by analyzing a collection of 23,588 pol sequences, collected for drug resistance testing from 45 states during 2004&ndash;2011. To this end, we introduce a workflow to reduce this large collection of data to more computationally-manageable sample sizes and apply the BEAST framework to test which covariates associate with the spread of HIV-1 across state borders. Our results show that we are able to consistently identify certain predictors of spread under reasonable run times across datasets of up to 10,000 sequences. However, the general lack of phylogenetic structure and the high uncertainty associated with HIV trees make it difficult to interpret the epidemiological relevance of the drivers of spread we are able to identify. While the workflow we present here could be applied to other virus datasets of a similar scale, the characteristic star-like shape of HIV-1 phylogenies poses a serious obstacle to reconstructing a detailed evolutionary and spatial history for HIV-1 subtype B in the US.","2020-02","2020-02-07 08:18:12","2020-02-07 08:18:12","2020-02-07 08:16:57","182","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","","","","phylogeography; BEAST; phylodynamics; HIV; BEAGLE; covariates; predictors; spread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains unclear, however, how such trade-offs impact sub-lethal pathogen-inflicted damage, and whether these trade-offs even occur in broad host-range pathogens. Here, we examine changes over the past 110 years in symptoms induced in maize by the broad host-range pathogen, maize streak virus (MSV). Specifically, we use the quantified symptom intensities of cloned MSV isolates in differentially resistant maize genotypes to phylogenetically infer ancestral symptom intensities and check for phylogenetic signal associated with these symptom intensities. We show that whereas symptoms reflecting harm to the host have remained constant or decreased, there has been an increase in how extensively MSV colonizes the cells upon which transmission vectors feed. This demonstrates an evolutionary trade-off between amounts of pathogen-inflicted harm and how effectively viruses position themselves within plants to enable onward transmission.","2020-01-15","2020-01-16 07:15:56","2020-01-16 07:19:31","","e51984","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","Rokas, Antonis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an insect-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in Northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of Euros. Though the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly a closely-related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this period without replication, we conclude that the second outbreak was most likely initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008.

This study aimed at describing the sequence variability of Lassa virus across Nigeria and inferring its spatio-temporal evolution. We sequenced and isolated 77 Lassa virus strains from 16 Nigerian States. The final dataset, including previous works, comprised metadata and sequences of 219 unique strains sampled between 1969 and 2018 in 22 States. Most of this data originated from Lassa fever patients diagnosed at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. The majority of sequences clustered with the main Nigerian lineages II and III, while few sequences formed a new cluster related to Lassa virus strains from Hylomyscus pamfi. Within lineages II and III, seven and five sub-lineages, respectively, were distinguishable. The phylogeographic analysis suggests an origin of lineage II in the southeastern part of the country around Ebonyi State and a main vector of dispersal towards the west across the Niger River, through Anambra, Kogi, Delta, and Edo into Ondo State. The frontline of virus dispersal appears to be in Ondo. Minor vectors are directed northeast towards Taraba and Adamawa and south towards Imo and Rivers. Lineage III might have spread from northern Plateau State into Kaduna, Nasarawa, Federal Capital Territory, and Bauchi. One sub-lineage moved south and crossed the Benue River into Benue State. This study provides a geographic mapping of lineages and phylogenetic clusters in Nigeria at higher resolution. In addition, we estimated the direction and timeframe of virus dispersal in the country.IMPORTANCE Lassa virus is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of approximately 30% in Africa. Previous studies disclosed a geographical pattern in the distribution of Lassa virus strains and a westward movement of the virus across West Africa during evolution. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geography of genetic lineages and sub-lineages of the virus in Nigeria. In addition, we modeled how the virus spread in the country. This knowledge allows predicting into which geographical areas the virus might spread in future and prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance. Our study not only aimed at generating Lassa virus sequences from across Nigeria, but also to isolate and conserve the respective viruses for future research. Both isolates and sequences are important for the development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to treat and prevent Lassa fever, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","2019","2019-09-06 07:09:08","2019-11-21 09:43:41","","e00929-19","","","93","","J.

Spatially-explicit reconstructions of viral spread represent valuable sources of lineage movement data that can be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal of pathogens. Here, we performed phylogeographic inference and applied different post-hoc approaches to analyse a new and comprehensive data set of viral genomes to elucidate the dispersal history and dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) in Iran, which have remained largely unknown. We first analysed the association between environmental factors and variations in dispersal velocity among lineages. Secondly, we present, test and apply a new approach to study the link between environmental conditions and the dispersal direction of lineages. The statistical performance (power of detection, false positive rate) of this new method was assessed using simulations. We performed phylogeographic analyses of RABV genomes, allowing us to describe the large diversity of RABV in Iran and to confirm the co-circulation of several clades in the country. Overall, we estimate a relatively high lineage dispersal velocity, similar to previous estimates for dog rabies virus spread in northern Africa. Finally, we highlight a tendency for RABV lineages to spread in accessible areas associated with high human population density. Our analytical workflow illustrates how phylogeographic approaches can be used to investigate the impact of environmental factors on several aspects of viral dispersal dynamics.

Improved predictions of population distribution changes over time require the use of a limited number of covariates that are time-invariant or temporally explicit.

In 2006, an atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand. This study aimed to provide a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors. This should provide a basis for improving disease surveillance and control of PRRS in Thailand. RESULTS: Spatial scan statistics were used to detect clusters of outbreaks and allowed the identification of six spatial clusters covering 15 provinces of Thailand. Two modeling approaches were used to relate the presence or absence of PRRS outbreaks at the sub-district level to demographic characteristics of pig farming and other epidemiological spatial variables: autologistic multiple regressions and boosted regression trees (BRT). The variables showing a statistically significant association with PRRS presence in the autologistic multiple regression model were the sub-district human population and number of farms with breeding sows. The predictive power of the model, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots was moderate. BRT models had higher goodness of fit the metrics and identified the sub-district human population and density of farms with breeding sows as important predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country.","2014-08-05","2016-11-10 13:41:48","2021-06-29 08:15:00","","174","","","10","","BMC Vet.

We propose that even such successful advances are insufficient for many emergent diseases. We review work hypothesizing that Makona, phenotypically similar to much smaller outbreaks, emerged out of shifts in land use brought about by neoliberal economics. The epidemiological consequences demand a new science that explicitly addresses the foundational processes underlying multispecies health, including the deep-time histories, cultural infrastructure, and global economic geographies driving disease emergence. The approach, for instance, reverses the standard public health practice of segregating emergency responses and the structural context from which outbreaks originate. In Ebola's case, regional neoliberalism may affix the stochastic ""friction"" of ecological relationships imposed by the forest across populations, which, when above a threshold, keeps the virus from lining up transmission above replacement. Export-led logging, mining, and intensive agriculture may depress such functional noise, permitting novel spillovers larger forces of infection. Mature outbreaks, meanwhile, can continue to circulate even in the face of efficient vaccines. More research on these integral explanations is required, but the narrow albeit welcome success of the vaccine may be used to limit support of such a program.","2016","2016-11-09 20:27:03","2021-06-29 07:41:00","","149-165","","1","46","","Int J Health Serv","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26581892","","","","","Humans; Disease Outbreaks; Forests; vaccine; Africa, Western; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cultural Characteristics; ebola; Ebola Vaccines; ecological stochasticity; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; neoliberalism; Politics; Structural One Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","2011-12-01","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","196-205","","3","102","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza control along poultry market chains in South China","Special Issue: GEOVET 2010A Conference on the Application of Spatial Analytical Methods Used in Animal HealthGEOVET 2010","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","H5N1; KEY3","Poultry; avian influenza; HPAI H5N1; Market chains; Risk assessment; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential geographic extent of potential re-emerging epidemics is unknown, as are the factors associated with it. Using newly assembled data sets of the locations of 8,943 live-poultry markets in China and maps of environmental correlates, we develop a statistical model that accurately predicts the risk of H7N9 market infection across Asia. Local density of live-poultry markets is the most important predictor of H7N9 infection risk in markets, underscoring their key role in the spatial epidemiology of H7N9, alongside other poultry, land cover and anthropogenic predictor variables. Identification of areas in Asia with high suitability for H7N9 infection enhances our capacity to target biosurveillance and control, helping to restrict the spread of this important disease.","2014-06-17","2015-09-22 14:32:06","2021-06-25 18:30:45","2015-09-22 14:32:06","4116","","","5","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km 2 ). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations.","2016-03-15","2016-04-13 13:06:38","2021-06-29 08:01:46","2016-04-13 13:06:38","e0150424","","3","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","map-people-livestock; mapping-livestock; livestock-disease-mapping","Africa; Asia; Machine learning; Cattle; Census; Chickens; Livestock; Farms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, in deriving populations at risk of disease estimates, these spatial models must rely on existing global and regional datasets on population distribution, which are often based on outdated and coarse resolution data. Moreover, a variety of different methods have been used to model population distribution at large spatial scales. In this review we describe the main global gridded population datasets that are freely available for health researchers and compare their construction methods, and highlight the uncertainties inherent in these population datasets. We review their application in past studies on disease risk and dynamics, and discuss how the choice of dataset can affect results. Moreover, we highlight how the lack of contemporary, detailed and reliable data on human population distribution in low income countries is proving a barrier to obtaining accurate large-scale estimates of population at risk and constructing reliable models of disease spread, and suggest research directions required to further reduce these barriers.","2012-03-20","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","7","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","En","2012 Linard and Tatem; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large epidemic in 2016–17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016–17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of Feb 23, 2017, from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Between Feb 19, 2013, and Feb 23, 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013–14, 219 in 2014–15, 114 in 2015–16, and 447 in 2016–17. The 2016–17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41% (55 of 134) to 57% (254 of 447) from the first epidemic to the 2016–17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 epidemics (63% [72 of 114] and 61% [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the first three epidemics (39% [52 of 134], 55% [169 of 306], and 56% [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016–17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Age distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection with A H7N9 virus.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars.</p>","2017-06-02","2017-06-04 08:17:37","2017-06-04 08:17:37","2017-06-04 08:17:37","","","0","0","","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","Epidemiology of avian influenza A H7N9 virus in human beings across five epidemics in mainland China, 2013–17","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SCP of acclimated adult ladybirds which were allowed to complete development to adulthood at 18 °C and a 8:16(L:D)h photoperiod, or at 25 °C and a 16:8(L:D)h photoperiod, and which were subsequently kept at 10 °C and a 12:12(L:D)h photoperiod for seven days, was −17.4 and −16.8 °C, respectively. These SCP-values were approximately 7 °C lower than the value of −9.9 °C for non-acclimated ladybirds maintained at a temperature of 25 °C and a photoperiod of 16:8(L:D)h throughout development and in the first week of their adult life. Also food source had a significant effect on the freezing temperature of C. montrouzieri: the SCP of ladybirds fed the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso)(Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), was 1.6 °C higher than the value of −17.2 °C observed for ladybirds provided with eggs of the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).

All individuals exposed to a constant 5 °C had died by day 24. Based on the results from this laboratory study, it is deemed unlikely that C. montrouzieri could establish outdoors in western Europe, and it is therefore expected to pose little risk to non-target species in this area when used as an augmentative biological control agent.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:30:26","","199-207","","2","60","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Coleoptera; biological control; Coccinellidae; Entomologie; Environmental risk assessment; Sciences agronomiques; Cold tolerance; Non-native species; Predator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such changes affect the dynamics of the interaction between major forest pest species, such as bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), and their host trees. Normally breeding mostly in broken or severely stressed spruce; at high population densities some bark beetle species can colonise and kill healthy trees on scales ranging from single trees in a stand to multi-annual landscape-wide outbreaks. In Eurasia, the largest outbreaks are caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (Linnaeus), which is common and shares a wide distribution with its main host, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.). A large literature is now available, from which this review aims to synthesize research relevant for the population dynamics of I. typographus and co-occurring species under changing conditions. We find that spruce bark beetle population dynamics tend to be metastable, but that mixed-species and age-heterogeneous forests with good site-matching tend to be less susceptible to large-scale outbreaks. While large accumulations of logs should be removed and/or debarked before the next swarming period, intensive removal of all coarse dead wood may be counterproductive, as it reduces the diversity of predators that in some areas may play a role in keeping I. typographus populations below the outbreak threshold, and sanitary logging frequently causes edge effects and root damage, reducing the resistance of remaining trees. It is very hard to predict the outcome of interspecific interactions due to invading beetle species or I. typographus establishing outside its current range, as they can be of varying sign and strength and may fluctuate depending on environmental factors and population phase. Most research indicates that beetle outbreaks will increase in frequency and magnitude as temperature, wind speed and precipitation variability increases, and that mitigating forestry practices should be adopted as soon as possible considering the time lags involved.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 08:17:53","","34-51","","1","87","","","","","","","","","","other","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Entomologie; bark beetles; Population dynamics; Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Forest pests; Forestry; Ips typographus; Outbreak dynamics; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Zoologie forestierecynégétique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we compare the distribution (Belgium and Britain) and abundance (Belgium, Britain and Switzerland) of formerly common and widespread native ladybirds before and after the arrival of Harmonia axyridis, a globally rapidly expanding IAS. Location Europe Methods We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to assess the distribution trends of eight conspicuous and historically widespread and common species of ladybird within Belgium and Britain before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. The distribution data were collated largely through public participatory surveys but verified by a recognized expert. We also used GLMMs to model trends in the abundance of ladybirds using data collated through systematic surveys of deciduous trees in Belgium, Britain and Switzerland. Results Five (Belgium) and seven (Britain) of eight species studied show substantial declines attributable to the arrival of H. axyridis. Indeed, the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, declined by 30% (Belgium) and 44% (Britain) over 5years after the arrival of H. axyridis. Trends in ladybird abundance revealed similar patterns of declines across three countries. Main conclusion Together, these analyses show H. axyridis to be displacing native ladybirds with high niche overlap, probably through predation and competition. This finding provides strong evidence of a causal link between the arrival of an IAS and decline in native biodiversity. Rapid biotic homogenization at the continental scale could impact on the resilience of ecosystems and severely diminish the services they deliver. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2012-02-01","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 08:16:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Entomologie; Ecologie; Harmonia axyridis, biological invasions, intra-guild predation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy at the start of the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e.g. 1-30 days). Under both low (4°C after 5 days at 16°C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16°C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e.g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4°C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16°C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the oak processionary moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

To investigate the impact of such traits, we focused on two Eurasian spruce bark beetles that share a similar geographical distribution, but differ in their ecology and reproduction. Ips typographus is an aggressive tree-killing species characterized by strong dispersal, whereas Dendroctonus micans is a discrete inbreeding species (sib-mating is the rule), parasite of living trees and a poor disperser. We compared genetic variation between the two species over both beetles' entire range in Eurasia with five independent gene fragments, to evaluate whether their intrinsic differences could have an influence over their phylogeographic patterns. We highlighted widely divergent patterns of genetic variation for the two species, and argue that the difference is indeed largely compatible with their contrasting dispersal strategies and modes of reproduction. In addition, genetic structure in I. typographus divides European populations in a northern and a southern group, as was previously observed for its host plant, and suggests past allopatric divergence. A long divergence time was estimated between East Asian and other populations of both species, indicating their long-standing presence in Eurasia, prior to the last glacial maximum. Finally, the strong population structure observed in D. micans for the mitochondrial locus provides insights into the recent colonization history of this species, from its native European range to regions where it was recently introduced.

At endemic levels, these species are restricted to poorly defended resources, such as wind-felled, lightning-struck, or suppressed trees. It is poorly understood how these scattered and unpredictable resources are discovered and exploited. In this prospect, the collective foraging shown by most bark beetles, in the form of independent searching by individual beetles combined with mutual attention to each other's chemical signals, represents an efficient strategy to increase the probability to discover the resources. In order to explore the role of host distribution and collective foraging on the discovery of and settlement on wind-felled trees by bark beetles at endemic population densities, we developed a spatially explicit foraging model for the major forest pest in Europe, Ips typographus. The model is based on the diffusion of the beetles, the landing of pioneers on wind-felled trees realistically distributed based on field observations in southern Belgium, and the response of flying beetles to pheromones emitted by these pioneers. The results show that social foraging effectively increases the proportion of beetles that landed on wind-felled resources compared to solitary foragers. Furthermore, the model highlights the parameters that influenced the foraging strategy of I. typographus and that need narrower quantification in further experiments. Finally, in the frame of the tested parameters, the model highlights the existence of thresholds in the reproduction rate and in the size of the starting population under which populations collapse. If confirmed, this prediction would shed new light on the understanding of foraging at low, endemic population levels.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 08:13:43","","188-199","","","337","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Population dynamics; Forest pests; Collective behaviour; Technologie de l'environnement, contrôle de la pollution; Thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Necroses, ambrosia-beetle and fungal attacks were observed on the trunks. The symptoms were similar to previous events reported throughout the 20th Century. 2 One current hypothesis is that these phenomena were related to early frost events for which the trees were physiologically unprepared and which made them vulnerable to biotic attacks. In the present study, we aimed to test this hypothesis further, by retrospective meteorological analyses and also by an experimental approach. 3 Our meteorological analyses highlighted the occurrence of cold waves a year before the beech declines were reported in 1929, 1942 and 1998. 4 In our experimental approach, frost injuries were inflicted to mature trees in a beech stand using dry ice. The treated trees were more attractive to insects than untreated controls. Insect attacks were observed in the treated zones on the trees but colonization was not very successful. The galleries had aborted most of the time with only a few larval chambers. Very few insects were caught in emergence traps. 5 The results of these two approaches support and strengthen the hypothesis that frost induced beech dieback. Frost injuries increased tree attraction to ambrosia beetles to the point of inducing attacks. However, the overall success of these attacks was much lower than that observed in the 2000s. These differences might reflect limitations in our experimental approach, where frost wounding was applied locally to the trees. © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.","2013","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:21:31","","157-167","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Entomologie; Ecologie; Sylviculture; Aménagement forestier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enterobacteria were the most prevalent bacteria, in particular Rahnella, Pantoea and Ewingella, in addition to Streptomyces. Likewise, the yeasts Candida/Cyberlindnera were the most prominent fungi. All these microorganisms are widespread among tree-inhabiting insects with various ecologies, but their high prevalence overall might indicate a beneficial role such as detoxification of tree defenses, diet supplementation or protection against pathogens. As such, our results enable comparisons of symbiont communities of parasitic bark beetles with those of other beetles, and will contribute to our understanding of how microbial symbioses facilitate dietary shifts in insects.","2016-07-06","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:17:41","","","","9","92","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Bacteria; Dendroctonus; Ecology; Entomologie; Ecologie [animale]; Biologie; Fungi; insect symbiosis; Microbiologie et protistologie [entomologie,phytoparasitolog.]; parasitic bark beetles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hosts face trade-offs in the allocation of resources in growth and reproduction or in defense, and the defense/resources status varies with time after host's death or weakening event. Tree-killing bark beetles at endemic levels must choose along a spectrum, compromising between encountering minimal defense and facing high competition, or benefiting from high nutritional quality but facing high host defense. The relationships between resources and defenses in dead/dying trees have not been quantitatively assessed to date, because most studies focus on epidemic conditions. We measured the changes in constitutive and induced defenses in the phloem of spruce trees artificially uprooted at different times (up to 17 months prior to experiment initiation) and treated with methyl-jasmonate (MeJ) in order to induce chemical defense. We measured the effect of these changes on different steps of the host selection process and brood success of a major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae).Our results show that uprooted trees maintain some level of constitutive defenses, in particular monoterpenes, that decrease with time after uprooting. Moreover, the trees maintain some inducibility and can produce monoterpenes in response to MeJ treatment up to 7 months after uprooting. These defenses are correlated in part with the energy available in the phloem, but are likely too weak to exert pressure on the beetles' success and selection, the latter being related to the amount of energy available. Our results confirm that wind-felled trees are poorly defended, consistent with the hypothesis of the evolution of the tree-killing behavior from saprophagy in response to an overwhelming interspecific competition on undefended hosts. Wind-felled trees still represent a useful resource, exposing endemic populations of aggressive beetles to low defense levels while facilitating reproduction, growth and development. The constraint on the beetles' populations then becomes the ability to locate these scattered and unpredictable resources.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 08:13:52","","44-50","","","359","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Ips typographus; Sylviculture; Bark beetle ecology; Droit de l'environnement; Economie de l'environnement et des ressources naturelles; Endemic populations; Environnement et pollution; Inducible defenses; Terpenes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficiency of the HD/R strategy for both these Bt toxins.

For many insects, reproductive success in patchily-distributed species can be improved by sibling-mating. Inmany cases, such strategies correspond to sexual dimorphism, with males–whose reproductive activities can take place withoutdispersal–investing less energy in development of dispersive resources such as large body size and wings. This dimorphism isparticularly likely when males have little or no chance of mating outside their place of birth, such as when sperm competitionprecludes successful fertilisation in females that have already mated. The economically important bark beetle pest speciesDendroctonus micans (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) has been considered to be exclusively sibling-mating, with 90% offemales having already mated with their brothers by emergence. The species does not, however, show strong sexualdimorphism; males closely resemble females, and have been observed flying through forests. We hypothesised that this lack ofsexual dimorphism indicates that male D. micans are able to mate with unrelated females, and to sire some or all of theiroffspring, permitting extrafamilial reproduction. Using novel microsatellite markers, we carried out cross-breeding laboratoryexperiments and conducted paternity analyses of resulting offspring.

The discovery of two larvae of Anoplophora chinensis (citrus longhorn beetle - CLB) in 2009, at a nursery importing Acer palmatum from China in one of the major Dutch tree nursery areas, has resulted in the creation of a detailed dataset on the intra- European Union trade in its potential hosts.

In addition, shipments of Acer spp. from 138 producers in the nursery area in 2009 were analysed in a one-offanalysis of intra-EU trade. The volume of Acer spp. imports from Asia was stable early during the studied period, and declined to 5% of the initial imports after a period of interceptions, illustrating the effect of regulations. The number of notifications of A. chinensis infestations in imported consignments of Acer spp. increased sharply in the years up to 2007, then declined as imports also reduced. Although plants were shipped to destinations throughout Europe, each producer shipped plants only to few destinations in few countries. Most of the plants were shipped to nurseries in EU countries. These patterns could make it easier to target these high risk destinations for control measures. The lack of transaction records makes it difficult to trace the destination of plants. More systematic electronic record keeping by traders and growers and the data being collated in a database that can be made available to regulatory authorities, together with further studies of plant trade data using network approaches, would be beneficial for improving trace-back and trace-forward and provide better safeguards for plant health and quality.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:18:25","","1-20","","","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Généralités; Citrus longhorn beetle (Anoplophora chinensis Forster); international trade; Invasive alien insects; Japanese maple (Acer palmatum Thunb.); Plants for planting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive phytosanitary inspections.","2017-06-07","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-10 05:00:16","1-15","","","","","Biol Invasions","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The specificity of R. grandis relies on kairomones which female predators use to adjust their oviposition to the number of prey larvae available in a gallery. Yet these chemical signals are still largely unknown. The North American D. punctatus and D. valens, which are not sympatric with R. grandis but have a similar ecology as D. micans, could also elicit predator oviposition, which would suggest that specificity in this predator-prey system is constrained by geography. In order to further identify these determinants of specificity, we used artificial oviposition boxes to compare the oviposition level of R. grandis in the presence of larvae of each of the three prey species. We jointly used sequential dynamic headspace extractions and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate oviposition stimuli associated with each prey species and potential oviposition inhibitors emitted by the predator. We further assessed potential stimuli with the analysis of emissions from D. micans larvae reared alone. Overall, we identified and quantified 67 compounds, mostly terpenes. Several robust candidate stimulants or inhibitors of R. grandis’ oviposition were identified. The three prey species elicited similar oviposition levels in R. grandis, which suggests that this predator could form new associations outside of its native range.","2017-08-01","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:17:33","","778-793","","8","43","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In September 2016, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly recognized the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in animals as a leading cause of rising AMR. In September 2018, the interagency group established by the UN Secretary General will report on progress in the global response to AMR, including antimicrobial consumption in animals. We provide a baseline to monitor efforts to reduce antimicrobial use and assess how three global policies might curb antimicrobial consumption in food animal production: (i) enforcing global regulations to cap antimicrobial use, (ii) adherence to nutritional guidelines leading to reduced meat consumption, and (iii) imposing a global user fee on veterinary antimicrobial use.","2017-09-29","2017-09-29 08:26:05","2017-10-04 11:24:58","2017-09-29 08:26:05","1350-1352","","6358","357","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In laboratory experiments, adaline was unambiguously detected in fourth instar larvae of H. axyridis having ingested one egg or one first instar larva of Adalia bipunctata. Although prey alkaloids in the predator decreased with time, traces were still detected in pupae, exuviae and imagines of H. axyridis having ingested one prey when they were fourth instar larvae. Analysis of H. axyridis larvae collected in two potato fields shows for the first time in Europe the presence of exogenous alkaloids in 9 out of 28 individuals tested.

Dose–response of the beetle was first examined in a trapping experiment in August 1999. The major pheromone components of I. typographus, (S)-cis-verbenol (cV) and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MB) were released from window traps. Five treatments were replicated five times: (1) blank trap, (2) 0.03 and 1.2, (3) 0.11 and 4.5, (4) 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and (5) Pheroprax. Trap catches increased linearly as a function of increasing release rates of cV and MB. A second study aimed at making preliminary observations on the attraction range of the pheromones as compared to Pheroprax. A release–recapture experiment was carried out in May 2000: four trap-trees located 50 m away from a central release platform were equipped with window traps baited with increasing release rates, tested in separate releases: 0.03 and 1.2; 0.11 and 4.5; 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and Pheroprax. Recaptures increased with the release rate. Trap catches were different at lower release rates, but not between the release rate of 15.2 mg/day of MB and Pheroprax. Variations in captures in relation to wind parameters showed persistently random flight at the lower release rates. Significant upwind flight was observed for Pheroprax only.

These new viruses, mostly of subtype H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8 belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, have been found in several Asian countries and have caused outbreaks in poultry in China, South Korea, and Vietnam. HPAI H5Nx also have spread over considerable distances with the introduction of viruses belonging to the same 2.3.4.4 clade in the U.S. (2014-2015) and in Europe (2014-2015 and 2016-2017). In this paper, we examine the emergence and spread of these new viruses in Asia in relation to published datasets on HPAI H5Nx distribution, movement of migratory waterfowl, avian influenza risk models, and land-use change analyses. More specifically, we show that between 2000 and 2015, vast areas of northeast China have been newly planted with rice paddy fields (3.21 million ha in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) in areas connected to other parts of Asia through migratory pathways of wild waterfowl. We hypothesize that recent land use changes in northeast China have affected the spatial distribution of wild waterfowl, their stopover areas, and the wild-domestic interface thereby altering transmission dynamics of avian influenza viruses across flyways. Detailed studies of the habitat use by wild migratory birds, of the extent of the wild-domestic interface, and of the circulation of avian influenza viruses in those new planted areas may help to shed more light on this hypothesis, and on the possible impact of those changes on the long-distance patterns of avian influenza transmission.","2017","2017-12-20 11:55:43","2021-06-29 08:02:49","2017-12-20 11:55:43","","","","4","","Front.

This parameter provides a first indication of an insect's establishment potential in a new region and of its possible geographical range. Allowing the predatory bugs to adapt to lower temperatures resulted in an increase in supercooling ability. Macrolophus pygmaeus bugs exposed to antibiotics in their artificial diet and hence cured from their infection with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis, Rickettsia bellii and R. limoniae were more tolerant to freezing than infected bugs. The diet of the predators also affected the freezing temperature of the body fluids. Predators fed an artificial diet based on egg yolk were less resistant to freezing than those fed Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs.

Prey tested in these experiments were: tobacco aphid Myzus persicae nicotianae (Sulzer)(Hemiptera: Aphididae), pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)(Hemiptera: Aphididae), tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)(Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), southern green stinkbug Nezara viridula (L.)(Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) eggs, western flower thrips Frankliniellaoccidentalis (Pergande)(Thysanoptera: Thripidae), two-spotted ladybird Adalia bipunctata (L.)(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) eggs and eggs of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella L.

Despite a prolongation of the preoviposition period with ca. eight days and a decrease in egg hatch by about 10 %, C. montrouzieri females fed moth eggs accepted the synthetic wadding as an oviposition substrate and deposited the same number of eggs their counterparts maintained on mealybugs. A mixture of E. kuehniella eggs with pollen yielded similar developmental and reproductive rates as E. kuehniella eggs alone, but a diet of bee pollen alone was not adequate for the predator.

However, most empirical support for this hypothesis comes from simple structured communities that are relatively easy to manipulate. The impact of forest biodiversity on forest ecosystem functioning has been far less studied. Experiment design - In this paper, we present the recently established, large-scale FORBIO experiment (FORest BIOdiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), specifically designed to test the effects of tree species diversity on forest ecosystem functioning. FORBIO's design matches with that of the few other tree diversity experiments worldwide, but at the same time, the FORBIO experiment is unique as it consists of a similar experimental set-up at three sites in Belgium (Zedelgem, Hechtel-Eksel and Gedinne) with contrasting edaphic and climatological characteristics. This design will help to provide answers to one of the most interesting unresolved questions in functional biodiversity research, notably whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning decrease in less stressful and more productive environments. At each site, FORBIO consists of 41 to 44 plots (127 plots in total) planted with monocultures and mixtures up to four species, selected from a pool of five site-adapted, functionally different tree species. When allocating the treatments to the plots, we maximally avoided any possible covariation between environmental factors. Monitoring of ecosystem functioning already started at the Zedelgem and Gedinne sites and will start soon in Hechtel-Eksel. Multiple processes are being measured and as the trees grow older, we plan to add even more processes. Expected results - Not only basic science, but also forest management will benefit from the results coming from the FORBIO experiment, as FORBIO is, for instance, also a test case for uncommon, not well-known tree species mixtures. To conclude, FORBIO is an important ecosystem experiment that has the potential to deliver badly needed insights into the multiple relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which will be valuable for both science and practice. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.","2013","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 08:15:53","","1-10","","1","146","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Ecologie; Sylviculture; Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research; Field experiment; Forest ecology; Forest management; Mixed forest; Tree diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In conclusion, this experiment suggests that drought has a negative impact on C. populi survival and feeding. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010.","2010","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:21:45","","209-214","","","67","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Entomologie; Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Agronomie générale; Drought stress; Ecologie chimique; herbivory; Populus; Tree-insect relationships; Water deficit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, a decline of some native coccinellid species was observed in tree habitats. One hypothesis about the cause of this decline was that it might have been due to intraguild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis. In natural conditions, IGP between coccinellids can be tracked by using defensive compounds. Exogenous alkaloids in H. axyridis were therefore examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), using individuals sampled from lime trees that were also occupied by other species of coccinellids. Harmonia axyridis was the dominant species at all life stages, in terms of both numbers of sites occupied and local abundance. The GC–MS analysis of H. axyridis larvae revealed traces of exogenous alkaloids from 19 of the 20 sites and, in nine of those 19 sites, more than 30% of the larvae analyzed contained exogenous alkaloids. Three alkaloids were detected: adaline from Adalia spp., calvine from Calvia spp. and propyleine from Propylea quatuordecimpunctata. Predation by H. axyridis on two different coccinellid species was also detected in the same larva, reinforcing the status of H. axyridis as a top predator. A generalized linear model indicated that IGP frequency was positively influenced by two variables: the abundance of extraguild and intraguild prey; and the interaction between these two variables. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that IGP by H. axyridis on native coccinellids in tree habitats has led to the decline of several of these species.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-07-02 11:19:53","","1805-1814","","","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Entomologie; Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Agronomie générale; Ecologie chimique; Alkaloids, Biological control, Biological invasions, Ladybirds, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid introduction of harmful organisms through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that <1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the inspection increased with lot size, but the probability that the infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0.95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0.6 in the other countries.

As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.","2018-07-18","2018-07-20 08:01:40","2021-06-29 07:33:36","2018-07-20 08:01:40","e0199547","","7","13","","PLoS One","Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in Mauritania","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","mapping-livestock; livestock-disease-mapping","Cattle; Livestock; Veterinary diseases; Camels; Sheep; Centrality; Mauritania; Ruminants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear what the increase in demand for antibiotics means for the occurrence of drug resistance in animals and risk to humans. Van Boeckel et al. describe the global burden of antimicrobial resistance in animals on the basis of systematic reviews over the past 20 years (see the Perspective by Moore). There is a clear increase in the number of resistant bacterial strains occurring in chickens and pigs. The current study provides a much-needed baseline model for low- and middle-income countries and provides a “one health” perspective to which future data can be added. Science, this issue p. eaaw1944; see also p. 1251 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe global scale-up in demand for animal protein is the most notable dietary trend of our time. Since 2000, meat production has plateaued in high-income countries but has grown by 68%, 64%, and 40% in Asia, Africa, and South America, respectively. The transition to high-protein diets in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been facilitated by the global expansion of intensive animal production systems in which antimicrobials are used routinely to maintain health and productivity. Globally, 73% of all antimicrobials sold on Earth are used in animals raised for food. A growing body of evidence has linked this practice with the rise of antimicrobial-resistant infections, not just in animals but also in humans. Beyond potentially serious consequences for public health, the reliance on antimicrobials to meet demand for animal protein is a likely threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry, and thus to the livelihood of farmers around the world. RATIONALEIn LMICs, trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals are poorly documented. In the absence of systematic surveillance systems, point prevalence surveys represent a largely untapped source of information to map trends in AMR in animals. We use geospatial models to produce global maps of AMR in LMICs and give policy-makers—or a future international panel—a baseline for monitoring AMR levels in animals and target interventions in the regions most affected by the rise of resistance. RESULTSWe identified 901 point prevalence surveys from LMICs reporting AMR rates in animals for common indicator pathogens: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. From 2000 to 2018, the proportion of antimicrobial compounds with resistance higher than 50% (P50) increased from 0.15 to 0.41 in chickens and from 0.13 to 0.34 in pigs and plateaued between 0.12 and 0.23 in cattle. Global maps of AMR (available at resistancebank.org) show hotspots of resistance in northeastern India, northeastern China, northern Pakistan, Iran, eastern Turkey, the south coast of Brazil, Egypt, the Red River delta in Vietnam, and the areas surrounding Mexico City and Johannesburg. Areas where resistance is just starting to emerge are Kenya, Morocco, Uruguay, southern Brazil, central India, and southern China. Uncertainty in our predictions was greatest in the Andes, the Amazon region, West and Central Africa, the Tibetan plateau, Myanmar, and Indonesia. Dense geographical coverage of point prevalence surveys did not systematically correlate with the presence of hotspots of AMR, such as in Ethiopia, Thailand, Chhattisgarh (India), and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). The highest resistance rates were observed with the most commonly used classes of antimicrobials in animal production: tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and penicillins. CONCLUSIONThe portfolio of antimicrobials used to raise animals for food is rapidly getting depleted, with important consequences for animal health, farmers’ livelihoods, and potentially for human health. Regions affected by the highest levels of AMR should take immediate actions to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials that are essential in human medicine by restricting their use in animal production. In some middle-income countries, particularly in South America, surveillance must be scaled up to match that of low-income African countries that are currently outperforming them despite more limited resources. Policy-makers coordinating the international response to AMR may consider sparing African countries from the most aggressive measures to restrict access to veterinary drugs, which may undermine livestock-based economic development and rightfully be perceived as unfair. However, in regions where resistance is starting to emerge, there is a window of opportunity to limit the rise of resistance by encouraging a transition to sustainable animal farming practices. High-income countries, where antimicrobials have been used on farms since the 1950s, should support this transition—for example, through a global fund to subsidize improvement in farm-level biosafety and biosecurity. <img class=""fragment-image"" aria-describedby=""F1-caption"" src=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6459/eaaw1944/F1.medium.gif""/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Animals raised for food use the majority of antimicrobials sold on Earth.The main article presents a map of antimicrobial resistance in animals in low- and middle-income countries where sales of veterinary antimicrobials remain largely unregulated.

Jetha] The global scale-up in demand for animal protein is the most notable dietary trend of our time. Antimicrobial consumption in animals is threefold that of humans and has enabled large-scale animal protein production. The consequences for the development of antimicrobial resistance in animals have received comparatively less attention than in humans. We analyzed 901 point prevalence surveys of pathogens in developing countries to map resistance in animals. China and India represented the largest hotspots of resistance, with new hotspots emerging in Brazil and Kenya. From 2000 to 2018, the proportion of antimicrobials showing resistance above 50% increased from 0.15 to 0.41 in chickens and from 0.13 to 0.34 in pigs. Escalating resistance in animals is anticipated to have important consequences for animal health and, eventually, for human health. Growing demand for meat in developing economies increases antibiotic consumption and fuels the risk of antibiotic resistance.

This comes with significant environmental, health and social impacts. To assess these impacts, detailed maps of livestock distributions have been developed by downscaling census data at the pixel level (10 km or 1 km), providing estimates of the density of animals in each pixel. However, these data remain at fairly coarse scale and many epidemiological or environmental science applications would make better use of data where the distribution and size of farms are predicted rather than the number of animals per pixel. Based on detailed 2010 census data, we investigated the spatial point pattern distribution of extensive and intensive chicken farms in Thailand. We parameterized point pattern simulation models for extensive and intensive chicken farms and evaluated these models in different parts of Thailand for their capacity to reproduce the correct level of spatial clustering and the most likely locations of the farm clusters. We found that both the level of clustering and location of clusters could be simulated with reasonable accuracy by our farm distribution models. Furthermore, intensive chicken farms tended to be much more clustered than extensive farms, and their locations less easily predicted using simple spatial factors such as human populations. These point-pattern simulation models could be used to downscale coarse administrative level livestock census data into farm locations. This methodology could be of particular value in countries where farm location data are unavailable.","2019-07-01","2019-09-24 11:36:04","2021-06-25 18:31:19","2019-09-24 11:36:04","335-344","","","173","","Agricultural Systems","Point pattern simulation modelling of extensive and intensive chicken farming in Thailand","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","mapping-livestock; livestock-disease-mapping","Agricultural intensification; Farm distribution model; Livestock production systems; Point pattern analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, most studies on the diversity–disease relationship focused on host species diversity without considering hosts’ phylogenetic relationships, which may lead to rejecting a species diversity effect when the community has host species that are only distantly related. Here, we explored the influence of waterbird community composition for determining HPAI H5N1 occurrence in wild birds in a continental-scale study across Europe. In particular, we tested the diversity–disease relationship using both host species diversity and host phylogenetic diversity. Our results provide the first demonstration that host community composition—compared with previously identified environmental risk factors—can also effectively explain the spatial pattern of H5N1 occurrence in wild birds. We further show that communities with more higher risk host species and more closely related species have a higher risk of H5N1 outbreaks. Thus, both host species diversity and community phylogenetic structure, in addition to environmental factors, jointly influence H5N1 occurrence. Our work not only extends the current theory on the diversity–disease relationship, but also has important implications for future monitoring of H5N1 and other HPAI subtypes.","2019","2019-09-24 11:35:05","2019-09-24 11:35:05","2019-09-24 11:35:05","1044-1053","","7","88","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we developed a map of the eco-climatic regions of Italy adopting a data-driven spatial clustering approach using recent and detailed spatial data on climatic and environmental factors. We selected seven variables, relevant for a broad set of human and animal vector-borne diseases (VBDs): standard deviation of altitude, mean daytime land surface temperature, mean amplitude and peak timing of the annual cycle of land surface temperature, mean and amplitude of the annual cycle of greenness value, and daily mean amount of rainfall. Principal Component Analysis followed by multivariate geographic clustering using the k-medoids technique were used to group the pixels with similar characteristics into different ecoregions, and at different spatial resolutions (250 m, 1 km and 2 km). We showed that the spatial structure of ecoregions is generally maintained at different spatial resolutions and we compared the resulting ecoregion maps with two datasets related to Bluetongue vectors and West Nile Disease (WND) outbreaks in Italy. The known characteristics of Culicoides imicola habitat were well captured by 2/22 specific ecoregions (at 250 m resolution). Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus occupy all sampled ecoregions, according to its known widespread distribution across the peninsula. WND outbreak locations strongly cluster in 4/22 ecoregions, dominated by human influenced landscape, with intense cultivations and complex irrigation network. This approach could be a supportive tool in case of VBDs, defining pixel-based areas that are conducive environment for VBD spread, indicating where surveillance and prevention measures could be prioritized in Italy. Also, ecoregions suitable to specific VBDs vectors could inform entomological surveillance strategies.","2019-07-03","2019-09-24 11:33:06","2021-06-29 07:33:47","2019-09-24 11:33:06","e0219072","","7","14","","PLoS One","Defining ecological regions in Italy based on a multivariate clustering approach","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","","Italy; Principal component analysis; Disease surveillance; Culicoides; Disease vectors; Entomology; Italian people; Surface temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tailored intervention measures require an understanding of the drivers of enzootic dynamics, commonly inferred from distorted human incidence data. Here, we use longitudinal sampling of approximately three decades of Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) evolution in isolated reservoir populations to estimate PUUV evolutionary rates, and apply these to study the impact of environmental factors on viral spread. We find that PUUV accumulates genetic changes at a rate of ∼10−4 substitutions per site per year and that land cover type defines the dispersal dynamics of PUUV, with forests facilitating and croplands impeding virus spread. By providing reliable short-term PUUV evolutionary rate estimates, this work facilitates the evaluation of spatial risk heterogeneity starting from timed phylogeographic reconstructions based on virus sampling in its animal reservoir, thereby side-stepping the need for difficult-to-collect human disease incidence data.","2019","2019-04-29 07:48:32","2021-07-02 11:21:52","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","landscape-phylogeography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combined data set represents an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare the environmental factors impacting the interconnectivity of these large mammals. The present study describes and uses a landscape genetic workflow to compare spatial patterns of genetic variability and the impact of environmental factors on genetic differentiation. For the latter analyses, we investigate the correlation between genetic and environmental distances (pairwise approach) and also between local genetic dissimilarity and environmental conditions (point approach). Preliminary analyses of CMR data confirm that motorways act as significant barriers to dispersal. However, analyses performed with the pairwise approach do not highlight any evidence of an impact of motorways on genetic differentiation, which is presumably due to their recent establishment. Complementary analyses performed with the point approach reveal that low altitude tends to be associated with higher genetic dissimilarity. From a methodological point of view, the present workflow illustrates the complementary application of both pairwise and point approaches, as well as univariate and multivariate analyses.","2019","2019-09-06 09:22:16","2021-07-02 11:17:10","","228-241","","2","123","","Heredity","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is crucial to understand the dynamics of the disease in the poultry industry to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of the risks of transmission and to establish a better distribution of resources when implementing control. In this paper, we develop a set of mathematical models that simulate the spread of HPAI H5N1 in the poultry industry in Thailand, utilising data from the 2004 epidemic. The model that incorporates the intensity of duck farming when assessing transmision risk provides the best fit to the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed outbreak, implying that intensive duck farming drives transmission of HPAI in Thailand. We also extend our models using a sequential model fitting approach to explore the ability of the models to be used in “real time” during novel disease outbreaks. We conclude that, whilst predictions of epidemic size are estimated poorly in the early stages of disease outbreaks, the model can infer the preferred control policy that should be deployed to minimise the impact of the disease.","2018-11-01","2019-02-01 14:50:04","2019-02-01 14:50:04","2019-02-01 14:50:04","171-181","","","159","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Dynamics of the 2004 avian influenza H5N1 outbreak in Thailand","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Avian influenza; Disease control; Spatial heterogeneity; Vaccination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. 2.We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. 3.Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographic range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections, and the cost of high resolution data. 4.Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.

In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth&rsquo;s surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.","2018-07-20","2018-07-20 07:50:24","2021-06-29 08:04:49","2018-07-20 07:50:24","1145","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","","","","built-up detection; landsat; openstreetmap; urban remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters of HPAI A (H5N1) virus emerged, leading to an important number of AI A (H5N1) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date, few studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A (H5N1) outbreaks in Egypt in relation to protective / risk factors at the farm level, a gap we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production, as a basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A (H5N1) presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta. Results: The probability of HPAI A (H5N1) presence was associated with several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status, absence of windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of production were found to be protective factors, whereas the presence of a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the village was found to be a risk factor. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A (H5N1) virus circulation, which could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt.","2018-12","2018-06-22 08:59:28","2018-06-22 08:59:29","2018-06-22 08:59:28","","","1","14","","","Avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks in different poultry farm types in Egypt","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data collected through active surveillance of Vietnamese live-bird markets (LBMs) between 2011 and 2015 were used to explore and compare the spatio-temporal distributions of H5N1- and H5N6-positive LBMs. Conditional autoregressive models were developed to quantify spatio-temporal associations between agro-ecological factors and the two HPAI strains using the same set of predictor variables. Unlike H5N1, which exhibited a strong north-south divide, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces, H5N6 was homogeneously distributed throughout Vietnam. Similarly, different agro-ecological factors were associated with each strain. Sample collection in the months of January and February and higher average maximum temperature were associated with higher likelihood of H5N1 positive market-day status. The likelihood of market-days being positive for H5N6 increased with decreased river density, and with successive Rounds of data collection.

Here we developed a dynamical species distribution modeling approach forecasting Ae. albopictus eggs abundance at high spatial (0.01 degree WGS84) and temporal (weekly) resolution over 10 Balkan countries, using temperature times series of Modis data products and altitude as input predictors. The model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated over Albania based observed eggs abundance data weekly monitored during three years. For a given week of the year, eggs abundance was mainly predicted by the number of eggs and the mean temperature recorded in the preceding weeks. That is, results are in agreement with the biological cycle of the mosquito, reflecting the effect temperature on eggs spawning, maturation and hatching. The model, seeded by initial egg values derived from a second model, was then used to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of eggs abundance over the selected Balkan countries, weekly in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Data were collected through phone and face-to-face interviews in almost all the regions in Mauritania over a period of roughly two weeks during June 2015. The analysis has shown the existence of two mobility patterns throughout the year: the first related to routine movements from January to August; the second strictly connected to the religious festivity of Tabaski that in 2014 occurred at the beginning of October. These mobility patterns are different in terms of animals involved (fewer cattle and dromedaries are traded around Tabaski), the means of transportation (the volume of animals moved by truck raises around Tabaski) and destinations (most of the animals are traded nationally around Tabaski). Due to the differences between these two periods, public health officers, researchers and other stakeholders should take account of the time of the year when implementing vaccination campaigns or creating surveillance networks.","2018-01-24","2018-01-25 14:01:13","2021-06-29 07:33:31","2018-01-25 14:01:13","e0191565","","1","13","","PLoS One","Towards the description of livestock mobility in Sahelian Africa","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","","Livestock; Human mobility; Sheep; Infectious disease control; Mauritania; Ruminants; Senegal; Transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The draft method has been tested on pests of concern to the European Union (EU). The method is adaptable and can focus either on all the steps and sub-steps of the assessment process or on specific parts if necessary. It is based on assessing changes in pest population abundance as the major driver of the impact on cultivated plants and on the environment. Like other pest risk assessment systems the method asks questions about the likelihood and magnitude of factors that contribute to risk. Responses can be based on data or expert judgment. Crucially, the approach is quantitative, and it captures uncertainty through the provision by risk assessors of quantile estimates of the probability distributions for the assessed variables and parameters. The assessment is based on comparisons between different scenarios, and the method integrates risk-reducing options where they apply to a scenario, for example current regulation against a scenario where risk-reducing options are not applied. A strategy has been developed to communicate the results of the risk assessment in a clear, comparable and transparent way, with the aim of providing the requestor of the risk assessment with a useful answer to the question(s) posed to the EFSA Plant Health Panel. The method has been applied to four case studies, two fungi, Ceratocystis platani and Cryphonectria parasitica, the nematode Ditylenchus destructor and the Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma.

Here we suggest that, in addition to many other traits, the dorsal spines of its larvae contribute to their success, as suggested by behavioural observations of agonistic interactions between H. axyridis and European coccinellids. In coccinellids, the role of dorsal spines in these interactions has been poorly studied and they could be a physical protection against intraguild predators. Dorsal spines of second instar H. axyridis larvae were removed with micro-scissors, which resulted in spineless larvae after moulting (spineless group). These larvae were then exposed to starved Coccinella septempunctata larvae. Two control categories were also submitted to interactions: H. axyridis larvae with all their spines (control group) and with their spines, but injured by pin stings (injured group). Spine removal at the second instar did not hamper H. axyridis development. The bite rate by C. septempunctata was significantly higher on the spineless H. axyridis and more dorsally located compared to the control and injured groups, while no bite rate difference was observed between the injured and the control group. Our results suggest that in addition to behavioural and chemical defenses, the dorsal spines play a significant protective role against bites. Therefore, spines in ladybirds could be considered as a morphological defense against intraguild predation. In H. axyridis, these defenses might contribute to its success in food resources already exploited by other guild members and thus further facilitate the invasion of new areas.","2017","2018-01-19 13:21:03","2021-06-29 08:03:31","2018-01-19 13:21:03","","","","5","","Front.

When a male beetle finds a suitable host, it releases pheromones that attract potential mates as well as other ‘spying’ males, which result in aggregations on the new host. To date, most studies have been concerned with the use of aggregation pheromones by bark beetles to overcome the defences of living, well-protected trees. How insects behave when facing undefended or poorly defended hosts remains largely unknown. The spatio-temporal pattern of resource colonization by the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, was quantified when weakly defended hosts (fallen trees) were attacked. In many of the replicates, colonization began with the insects rapidly scattering over the available surface and then randomly filling the gaps until a regular distribution was established, which resulted in a constant decrease in nearest-neighbour distances to a minimum below which attacks were not initiated. The scattered distribution of the first attacks suggested that the trees were only weakly defended. A minimal theoretical distance of 2.5 cm to the earlier settlers (corresponding to a density of 3.13 attacks dm−2) was calculated, but the attack density always remained lower, between 0.4 and 1.2 holes dm−2, according to our observations.","2018-01-01","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","170454","","1","5","","","Colonization of weakened trees by mass-attacking bark beetles","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

The protection of horizontal objects like logs or lying trees with anti-attractants was not always successful. In the future, positive results can be expected with an area covering spray applied by zeolite dispensers containing mixtures of verbenone and NHV. A similar approach could probably be used in aerial spraying of anti-attractants. We have succeeded in our attempt to protect zones of standing spruce trees from I. typographus attacks.

Its monospecific predator Rhizophagus grandis has followed its prey naturally into most areas and since the 1960s has also been mass-produced and released within newly infested locations. Assessing bark-beetle presence at previously uninfested sites, or predator establishment after release or natural spread, currently depends on direct observation of D. micans brood chambers. This is a slow and unreliable process because bark-beetle attacks are solitary, cryptic and occur on living trees. An effective trapping method would thus be most useful. * 2A synthetic lure for R. grandis was first field-tested in release–recapture experiments. Release points were surrounded by one or two concentric rings of traps baited with either D. micans larval frass or with a blend of synthetic chemicals. Kairomone-trapping using the synthetic lure was then tested in the field, monitoring R. grandis in 58 spruce stands in Belgium and France. * 3In the release–recapture experiments, up to 65% of the released predators were caught within 48 h. Catches with the synthetic lure and with prey frass were not significantly different. * 4Field-trapping assays showed R. grandis establishment in 30 stands, including areas where the predator had been introduced artificially. Trapping was unsuccessful at the southern and western limits of D. micans’ range. Combined visual and trapping approaches identified 32 stands containing the predators, with two false negatives with the trapping method, compared to 19 for the visual surveys. * 5Unexpectedly, male and female D. micans adults were trapped in some cases. The combined approach identified 43 attacked stands, among which there were four false negatives with the trapping method and 11 with the visual surveys. * 6Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of using kairomone traps to monitor a predator after releases for biocontrol. Furthermore, because this predator is strictly prey-specific, this technique also identifies stands colonized by D. micans bark beetles. Following inoculative predator releases, kairomone trapping could be used to survey for D. micans in areas under colonization or in European Union ‘Protected Zones’.","2008-04-01","2018-01-19 09:46:00","2021-07-02 11:23:28","","537-548","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","biological control; pheromones; beetles trapping; invasive pests monitoring; lures; oxygenated monoterpenes; predator–prey relationship; semiochemicals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, R. tutela was autogenous and tended to be more fecund under constrained conditions (9.7 vs. 5.1 total offspring per female). The longer pre-oviposition period of the specialist C. bostrichorum, coupled with its greater longevity, afforded the opportunity of better synchronization of ovipositing females with late instar larvae of I. typographus.

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.","2018-09-13","2018-10-10 09:27:23","2021-06-29 08:12:56","2018-10-10 09:27:23","e1006439","","9","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","","","","Epidemiology; Bangladesh; H5N1; Poultry; Livestock; Infectious disease control; Infectious disease surveillance; Vaccination and immunization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in ﬁve major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection signiﬁcantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or nonstructural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region.

Reports have documented antimicrobial use in the rapidly expanding aquaculture industry, which may contribute to the rise of antimicrobial resistance, carrying potential consequences for animal-, human-, and ecosystem-health. However, quantitative antimicrobial use across a highly diversified aquaculture industry is not well characterized. Here, we estimate global trends in antimicrobial use in aquaculture in 2017 and 2030 to help target future surveillance efforts and antimicrobial stewardship policies. We estimate antimicrobial use intensity (mg kg−1) for six species groups though a systematic review of point prevalence surveys, which identified 146 species-specific antimicrobial use rates. We project antimicrobial use in each country by combining mean antimicrobial use coefficients per species group with OECD/FAO Agricultural Outlook and FAO FishStat production volumes. We estimate global antimicrobial consumption in 2017 at 10,259 tons (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3163–44,727 tons), increasing 33% to 13,600 tons in 2030 (UI 4193–59,295). The Asia–Pacific region represents the largest share (93.8%) of global consumption, with China alone contributing 57.9% of global consumption in 2017. Antimicrobial consumption intensity per species group was: catfish, 157 mg kg−1 (UI 9–2751); trout, 103 mg kg−1 (UI 5–1951); tilapia, 59 mg kg−1 (UI 21–169); shrimp, 46 mg kg−1 (UI 10–224); salmon, 27 mg kg−1 (UI 17–41) and a pooled species group, 208 mg kg−1, (UI 70–622). All antimicrobial classes identified in the review are classified as medically important. We estimate aggregate global human, terrestrial and aquatic food animal antimicrobial use in 2030 at 236,757 tons (95% UI 145,525–421,426), of which aquaculture constitutes 5.7% but carries the highest use intensity per kilogram of biomass (164.8 mg kg−1). This analysis calls for a substantial scale-up of surveillance capacities to monitor global trends in antimicrobial use. Current evidence, while subject to considerable uncertainties, suggests that for some species groups antimicrobial use intensity surpasses consumption levels in terrestrial animals and humans. Acknowledging the fast-growing nature of aquaculture as an important source of animal nutrition globally, our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in a high-growth industry with broad links to water and ecosystem health.","2020-12-14","2021-02-01 18:05:13","2021-02-01 18:05:43","2021-02-01 18:05:05","21878","","1","10","","Sci.

Standing as an example, Bayesian multidimensional scaling (MDS) can help scientists learn viral trajectories through space-time, but its computational burden prevents its wider use. Crucial MDS model calculations scale quadratically in the number of observations. We partially mitigate this limitation through massive parallelization using multi-core central processing units, instruction-level vectorization and graphics processing units (GPUs). Fitting the MDS model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, GPUs can deliver more than 100-fold speedups over serial calculations and thus extend Bayesian MDS to a big data setting. To illustrate, we employ Bayesian MDS to infer the rate at which different seasonal influenza virus subtypes use worldwide air traffic to spread around the globe. We examine 5392 viral sequences and their associated 14 million pairwise distances arising from the number of commercial airline seats per year between viral sampling locations. To adjust for shared evolutionary history of the viruses, we implement a phylogenetic extension to the MDS model and learn that subtype H3N2 spreads most effectively, consistent with its epidemic success relative to other seasonal influenza subtypes. Finally, we provide MassiveMDS, an open-source, stand-alone C++ library and rudimentary R package, and discuss program design and high-level implementation with an emphasis on important aspects of computing architecture that become relevant at scale.","2021-01-02","2021-05-26 10:13:08","2021-05-26 10:13:08","2021-05-26 09:51:52","11-24","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2020.1754226","","","","","Bayesian phylogeography; Graphics processing unit; Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; Massive parallelization; multiple-data; Single-instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We map AMR at 10-kilometer resolution, finding resistance hotspots along Asia’s major river systems and coastal waters of China and India. Regions benefitting most from future surveillance efforts are eastern China and India. Scaling up surveillance to strengthen epidemiological evidence on AMR and inform aquaculture and fisheries interventions is needed to mitigate the impact of AMR globally.","2021-09-10","2021-09-14 10:50:35","2021-09-14 10:50:35","2021-09-14 10:50:12","5384","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Antimicrobial resistance;Fisheries;Microbial biooceanography;Policy and public health in microbiology Subject_term_id: antimicrobial-resistance;fisheries;microbial-biooceanography;policy-and-public-health-in-microbiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we build a phylogeographical model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 European countries and estimate that in many countries more than half of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since 15 June 2020. The success in onward transmission of newly introduced lineages was negatively associated with the local incidence of COVID-19 during this period. The pervasive spread of variants in summer 2020 highlights the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted, and this needs to be carefully considered in strategies to control the current spread of variants that are more transmissible and/or evade immunity.

In the last two decades, domestic dog populations have been shown to constitute the predominant reservoir of rabies in developing countries, causing 99% of human rabies cases. Despite substantial control efforts, dog rabies is still widely endemic and is spreading across previously rabies-free areas. Developing a detailed understanding of dog rabies dynamics and the impact of vaccination is essential to optimize existing control strategies and developing new ones. In this scoping review, we aimed at disentangling the respective contributions of mathematical models and phylodynamic approaches to advancing the understanding of rabies dynamics and control in domestic dog populations. We also addressed the methodological limitations of both approaches and the remaining issues related to studying rabies spread and how this could be applied to rabies control. Methodology/principal findings We reviewed how mathematical modelling of disease dynamics and phylodynamics have been developed and used to characterize dog rabies dynamics and control. Through a detailed search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, we identified a total of n = 59 relevant studies using mathematical models (n = 30), phylodynamic inference (n = 22) and interdisciplinary approaches (n = 7). We found that despite often relying on scarce rabies epidemiological data, mathematical models investigated multiple aspects of rabies dynamics and control. These models confirmed the overwhelming efficacy of massive dog vaccination campaigns in all settings and unraveled the role of dog population structure and frequent introductions in dog rabies maintenance. Phylodynamic approaches successfully disentangled the evolutionary and environmental determinants of rabies dispersal and consistently reported support for the role of reintroduction events and human-mediated transportation over long distances in the maintenance of rabies in endemic areas. Potential biases in data collection still need to be properly accounted for in most of these analyses. Finally, interdisciplinary studies were determined to provide the most comprehensive assessments through hypothesis generation and testing. They also represent new avenues, especially concerning the reconstruction of local transmission chains or clusters through data integration. Conclusions/significance Despite advances in rabies knowledge, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the mechanisms of local spread, the role of wildlife in dog rabies maintenance, and the impact of community behavior on the efficacy of control strategies including vaccination of dogs. Future integrative approaches that use phylodynamic analyses and mechanistic models within a single framework could take full advantage of not only viral sequences but also additional epidemiological information as well as dog ecology data to refine our understanding of rabies spread and control. This would represent a significant improvement on past studies and a promising opportunity for canine rabies research in the frame of the One Health concept that aims to achieve better public health outcomes through cross-sector collaboration.","2021","2021-09-19 15:22:12","2021-09-19 15:22:12","2021-09-19 15:21:08","e0009449","","5","15","","PLoS Negl.

We found that worker polymorphism was positively correlated with mature colony size, mean worker head width, and queen head width.

The spread of RYMV into and within the Republic of Niger was inferred as a continuous process using a Bayesian statistical framework applied previously to reconstruct its dispersal history in West Africa, East Africa, and Madagascar. The spatial resolution along this section of the Niger River was the highest implemented for RYMV and possibly for any plant virus. We benefited from the results of early field surveys of the disease for the validation of the phylogeographic reconstruction and from the well-documented history of rice cultivation changes along the Niger River for their interpretation. As a prerequisite, the temporal signal of the RYMV data sets was revisited in the light of recent methodological advances. The role of the hydrographic network of the Niger Basin in RYMV spread was examined, and the link between virus population dynamics and the extent of irrigated rice was assessed. RYMV was introduced along the Niger River in the Republic of Niger in the early 1980s from areas to the southwest of the country where rice was increasingly grown. Viral spread was triggered by a major irrigation scheme made of a set of rice perimeters along the river valley. The subsequent spatial and temporal host continuity and the inoculum build-up allowed for a rapid spread of RYMV along the Niger River, upstream and downstream, over hundreds of kilometres, and led to the development of severe epidemics. There was no evidence of long-distance dissemination of the virus through natural water. Floating rice in the main meanders of the Middle Niger did not contribute to virus dispersal from West Africa to Central Africa. RYMV along the Niger River is an insightful example of how agricultural intensification favours pathogen emergence and spread.","2021-09-01","2021-09-19 15:42:39","2021-09-19 15:42:39","2021-09-19 15:41:32","","","2","7","","Virus Evol.","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To translate this pattern of variation into an estimate of its capacity to disperse, we simulated SNP data under a spatially explicit model of population evolution (essentially a grid overlapping a map, in which each cell is considered a different population) and compared the simulated and real data with an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. For this purpose, we assessed a new SNP statistic, the DSVSF (distribution of spatial variation in SNP frequencies) that summarizes genetic variation in a spatially explicit context, and compared its usefulness to standard statistics often used in population genetic analyses. A test of our overall strategy was conducted with simulated data and showed that it can provide a good estimate of the level of dispersal of an organism over its geographic range. The results of our analyses suggested that this insect disperses well within the Vosges mountains, much more than was initially expected given the current and probably past fragmentation of its habitat and given the results of previous studies on genetic variation in other mountain leaf beetles.","2021-09-01","2021-10-01 18:29:06","2021-10-01 18:29:06","2021-10-01 18:24:54","","","5","5","","Insect Systematics and Diversity","Estimating Migration of Gonioctena quinquepunctata (Coleoptera","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These Ct values were evaluated against both a phase diagram predicting the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and an age-structured model estimating COVID-19 prevalence in Belgium.Results: Over 155,811 RT-PCR performed, 12,799 were positive and 7,910 Ct values were available for analysis. The 14-day median Ct values were negatively correlated with the 14-day mean daily positive tests with a lag of 17 days. In addition, the 14-day mean daily positive tests in LHUB-ULB were strongly correlated with the 14-day mean confirmed cases in the Brussels-Capital and in Belgium with coinciding start, peak, and end of the different waves of the epidemic. Ct values decreased concurrently with the forecasted phase-shifts of the diagram. Similarly, the evolution of 14-day median Ct values was negatively correlated with daily estimated prevalence for all age-classes.Conclusion: We provide preliminary evidence that trends of Ct values can help to both follow and predict the epidemic's trajectory at local and national levels, underlining that consolidated microbiology laboratories can act as epidemic sensors as they gather data that are representative of the geographical area they serve.","2021","2021-11-01 12:41:03","2021-11-01 12:41:03","2021-11-01 12:38:39","2036","","","8","","Front.

Objective: To understand the role of age and sex structures, health frailty, and contamination dynamics in COVID-19 mortality in populations living inside and outside care homes. Methods: We compared COVID-19 death data recorded in March–June 2020 in Wallonia (southern Belgium) for populations living inside and outside care homes, using annual death data (all-cause mortality in 2017) to assess the health condition of each population. Results: Sixty-four percent of COVID-19 deaths were residents in care homes, where the outbreak started after that in the external population, but at a faster pace. The death rate varied between 0‰ and 340‰ (mean 43‰) per care home, increasing with the number of both residents and staff. All-cause and COVID-19 mortality rates increased exponentially with age but were much higher in care homes. The ratio of male (M) to female (F) death rates was 1.6 for all-cause mortality and 2.0 for COVID-19 mortality (both confirmed and suspected). The COVID-19 mortality reached 24% (M) and 18% (F) of the all-cause mortality rate in care homes, compared to 5% (M) and 4% (F) outside care homes. Conclusions: The COVID-19 mortality rate was 130x higher inside than outside care homes, due to the near multiplicative effects of differences in the residents’ age and sex structure (11x), health frailty (3.8x), and infection risk (probably 3.5x). Contribution: Care homes should be treated as a very specific population in epidemiological studies due to their extreme vulnerability to COVID-19.","2021-11-04","2022-01-04 10:31:21","2022-01-04 10:31:21","2022-01-04 10:28:22","1011-1040","","33","45","","Demographic Research","A world apart","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Demographic Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a popular approach consists of parameterizing a discrete phylogeographic model as a generalized linear model to identify and analyse the predictors of the dispersal rates of viral lineages among discrete locations. However, such a full probabilistic inference is often computationally demanding and time-consuming. In the face of the increasing amount of viral genomes sequenced in epidemic outbreaks, there is a need for a fast exploration of covariates that might be relevant to consider in formal analyses. We here present PhyCovA (short for ‘Phylogeographic Covariate Analysis’), a web-based application allowing users to rapidly explore the association between candidate covariates and the number of phylogenetically informed transition events among locations. Specifically, PhyCovA takes as input a phylogenetic tree with discrete state annotations at the internal nodes, or reconstructs those states if not available, to subsequently conduct univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses, as well as an exploratory variable selection analysis. In addition, the application can also be used to generate and explore various visualizations related to the regression analyses or to the phylogenetic tree annotated by the ancestral state reconstruction. PhyCovA is freely accessible at https://evolcompvir-kuleuven.shinyapps.io/PhyCovA/ and also distributed in a dockerized form obtainable from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/timblokker/phycova.

Here we isolated an infectious Omicron virus in Belgium from a traveller returning from Egypt. We examined its sensitivity to nine monoclonal antibodies that have been clinically approved or are in development4, and to antibodies present in 115 serum samples from COVID-19 vaccine recipients or individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Omicron was completely or partially resistant to neutralization by all monoclonal antibodies tested. Sera from recipients of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, sampled five months after complete vaccination, barely inhibited Omicron. Sera from COVID-19-convalescent patients collected 6 or 12 months after symptoms displayed low or no neutralizing activity against Omicron. Administration of a booster Pfizer dose as well as vaccination of previously infected individuals generated an anti-Omicron neutralizing response, with titres 6-fold to 23-fold lower against Omicron compared with those against Delta. Thus, Omicron escapes most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and, to a large extent, vaccine-elicited antibodies.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae that may have originated from bats and leads to significant hazards and widespread epidemics in the swine population. The role of local and global trade of live swine and swine-related products in disseminating PEDV remains unclear, especially in developing countries with complex swine production systems. Here, we undertake an in-depth phylogeographic analysis of PEDV sequence data (including 247 newly sequenced samples) and employ an extension of this inference framework that enables formally testing the contribution of a range of predictor variables to the geographic spread of PEDV. Within China, the provinces of Guangdong and Henan were identified as primary hubs for the spread of PEDV, for which we estimate live swine trade to play a very important role. On a global scale, the United States and China maintain the highest number of PEDV lineages. We estimate that, after an initial introduction out of China, the United States acted as an important source of PEDV introductions into Japan, Korea, China, and Mexico. Live swine trade also explains the dispersal of PEDV on a global scale. Given the increasingly global trade of live swine, our findings have important implications for designing prevention and containment measures to combat a wide range of livestock coronaviruses.","2022-02-01","2022-03-21 20:27:52","2022-03-21 20:27:52","2022-03-21 20:26:40","msab364","","2","39","","Mol.

A multistep phylogenetic approach was used to characterize the dynamics of spread. The contributions of geospatial factors and HIV risk group to the local dynamics were evaluated.Phylogeographic analyses of the 2034 sequences revealed an important contribution of local transmission in sustaining the epidemic, as well as a complex viral migration network across the region. Geospatial viral dispersal between San Diego communities occurred predominantly among men who have sex with men, with central San Diego being the main source (34.9%) and recipient (39.5%) of migration events. HIV migration was more frequent from San Diego county towards Tijuana than vice versa. Migrations were best explained by the driving time between locations.The US-Mexico border may not be a major barrier to the spread of HIV, which may stimulate coordinated transnational intervention approaches. Whereas a focus on central San Diego has the potential to avert most spread, the substantial viral migration independent of central San Diego shows that county-wide efforts will be more effective. Combined, this work shows that epidemiological information gleaned from pathogen genomes can uncover mechanisms that underlie sustained spread and, in turn, can be a building block of public health decision-making.","2021-10-01","2022-03-21 20:34:51","2022-08-18 07:15:26","2022-03-21 20:32:50","e2018-e2025","","7","73","","Clinical Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that removing hunting pressure enhances the role of males in transmission, increases the viral population growth rate and increases the role of evolutionary forces on the pathogen compared to when hunting was reinstated. Changes in transmission observed with the removal of hunting could be linked to short-term social changes while the male puma population increased.

The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized ‘African’ and ‘Asian’ genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillance and response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to the emergence of new variants.","2022-01-01","2022-07-08 11:55:25","2022-07-08 11:55:25","2022-07-08 11:48:31","veac029","","1","8","","Virus Evolution","Genome-wide diversity of Zika virus","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detailed understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) regional transmission networks within sub-Saharan Africa is key for guiding local public health interventions against the pandemic. Methods:. Here, we analysed 1139 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from positive samples collected between March 2020 and February 2021 across six counties of Coastal Kenya (Mombasa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Kwale, Tana River, and Lamu) to infer virus introductions and local transmission patterns during the first two waves of infections. Virus importations were inferred using ancestral state reconstruction, and virus dispersal between counties was estimated using discrete phylogeographic analysis. Results:. During Wave 1, 23 distinct Pango lineages were detected across the six counties, while during Wave 2, 29 lineages were detected; 9 of which occurred in both waves and 4 seemed to be Kenya specific (B.1.530, B.1.549, B.1.596.1, and N.8). Most of the sequenced infections belonged to lineage B.1 (n = 723, 63%), which predominated in both Wave 1 (73%, followed by lineages N.8 [6%] and B.1.1 [6%]) and Wave 2 (56%, followed by lineages B.1.549 [21%] and B.1.530 [5%]). Over the study period, we estimated 280 SARS-CoV-2 virus importations into Coastal Kenya. Mombasa City, a vital tourist and commercial centre for the region, was a major route for virus imports, most of which occurred during Wave 1, when many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) government restrictions were still in force. In Wave 2, inter-county transmission predominated, resulting in the emergence of local transmission chains and diversity. Conclusions:. Our analysis supports moving COVID-19 control strategies in the region from a focus on international travel to strategies that will reduce local transmission. Funding:.

It is currently not known how climate and land use changes could affect the endemic area of this virus, currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring the environmental data associated with virus occurrence using ecological niche modelling, we show how temperature, precipitation and the presence of pastures determine ecological suitability for virus circulation. Based on projections of climate, land use, and population changes, we find that regions in Central and East Africa will likely become suitable for Lassa virus over the next decades and estimate that the total population living in ecological conditions that are suitable for Lassa virus circulation may drastically increase by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral genomes using spatially-explicit phylogeography and simulating virus dispersal, we find that in the event of Lassa virus being introduced into a new suitable region, its spread might remain spatially limited over the first decades.","2022-09-27","2022-09-27 09:58:20","2022-09-27 10:25:15","2022-09-27 09:55:42","5596","","1","13","","Nat.

The emergence of the Delta variant in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here we analyse 52,992 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from England together with 93,649 genomes from the rest of the world to reconstruct the emergence of Delta and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England in the context of changing travel and social restrictions. Using analysis of human movement, contact tracing and virus genomic data, we find that the geographic focus of the expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021. In England, Delta lineages were introduced more than 1,000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed. We find that hotel quarantine for travellers reduced onward transmission from importations; however, the transmission chains that later dominated the Delta wave in England were seeded before travel restrictions were introduced. Increasing inter-regional travel within England drove the nationwide dissemination of Delta, with some cities receiving more than 2,000 observable lineage introductions from elsewhere. Subsequently, increased levels of local population mixing—and not the number of importations—were associated with the faster relative spread of Delta. The invasion dynamics of Delta depended on spatial heterogeneity in contact patterns, and our findings will inform optimal spatial interventions to reduce the transmission of current and future variants of concern, such as Omicron (Pango lineage B.1.1.529).","2022-10","2022-10-14 07:05:25","2022-10-14 07:05:25","2022-10-14 07:02:37","154-160","","7930","610","","","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 7930 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Ecological epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Viral infection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to elucidate how Pleistocene climatic oscillations shaped lowland tropical rain forests by investigating the intraspecific diversity and evolutionary history of a widespread tree species. Location Guineo-Congolian rain forest, Central Africa. Taxon Staudtia kamerunensis Warb. (Myristicaceae). Methods We used genome skimming combined with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to infer the plastid phylogeny. We estimated the time of speciation and differentiation, genetic diversity, and we employed a continuous phylogeographical approach to infer the dispersal history of its plastid lineages. Results We sequenced an average of 5,827,783 reads per sample, and the reconstructed reference plastome had a mean depth of 73.3. We identified five plastid lineages that diverged during the Early or Middle Pleistocene and are parapatric, suggesting past population fragmentation. Four lineages are endemic to Lower Guinea, and one spans the Congo Basin. We found contrasting patterns of expansion in the two regions, with a rapid and recent range expansion of the Congolian lineage in the last 200,000 years, while the spread of the Lower Guinean lineages was substantially slower. Main conclusion The contrasting demographic histories between eastern and western lineages, associated with contrasted levels of plant species richness and rates of endemism, suggest that forest cover was more stable in Lower Guinea during the Late Pleistocene than in Congolia, where the biodiversity might have been eroded before the forest re-expanded in the Congo basin. This study illustrates how a continuous phylogeographical inference approach, mostly applied so far for inferring the spread of fast-evolving pathogens over months or years, can provide new insights to reconstruct the dispersal history of tropical tree species over thousands or millions of years.","2022","2022-10-14 07:07:36","2022-10-14 07:08:24","2022-10-14 07:06:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.14507","","","","","African rain forest; continuous phylogeographical inference; genome skimming; Myristicaceae; plastome sequencing; quaternary; Staudtia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
