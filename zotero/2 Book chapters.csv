They can be monogamous or polygamous, solitary or gregarious, and employ levels of parental care that range from gallery maintenance in many tribes to eusociality in some ambrosia beetles. Within this complexity, however, scolytines display some generalities that arise from reproducing within plants, such as sophisticated host location systems, morphological adaptations that facilitate tunneling, advanced communication systems that provide very specific information about plants, and close associations with microbial symbionts. Bark beetles produce pheromones that both attract mates and serve additional functions that vary with the beetles' host-plant relationships. Some species use aggregation pheromones to coordinate cooperative resource procurement, a behavior needed to overcome the sophisticated defenses of live trees. A broad array of microbial symbionts is associated with bark beetles, and these fungi and bacteria vary in their degrees of association, impacts, mechanisms, and functional substitutabilities. Some symbionts contribute to acquisition, utilization, and defense of the host plant resource, and some provide a direct food base. A wide array of predators, competitors, and parasites exploit bark beetles. Many of these natural enemies utilize chemical signals emanating from the beetles or their symbionts in host location, depending on the stage they attack. The habitat in which bark beetles reside poses significant challenges to predators and parasites, so their effects on population dynamics are often limited. Some behavioral, reproductive, and landscape patterns emerge when bark beetle species are functionally categorized by the physiological condition of host plants they colonize. Bark beetles play important and varied roles in ecosystem processes, contributing to biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and heterogeneity. They also pose challenges to resource management in both native and commercial ecosystems. The scale at which beetles exert impacts varies markedly among functional groups, with most species having very localized effects. A few species exert landscape-scale effects, and these ecosystem engineers are among the most pronounced disturbance agents of the biomes they help shape. Their population dynamics are characterized by cross-scale interactions, density-dependent feedbacks, plasticity in host selection decisions, critical thresholds at multiple levels of interaction, and multi-equilibria. A variety of anthropogenic inputs, specifically transport into new regions, habitat manipulations that homogenize forest structure or impede predators, and climatic changes such as elevated temperature and increased drought, increase the socioeconomic losses caused by both eruptive and historically noneruptive species.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 09:49:43","","1-40","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier Inc.","","en","","","","","","","","","","","bark beetles; Biology; Ecology; Généralités; Natural history; pheromones; Plant defense; Population dynamics; Scolytinae; Symbioses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"VNR4WX77","bookSection","2015","Grégoire, Jean-Claude; Raffa, Kenneth Francis K.F.; Lindgren, Staffan B.S.","Economics and Politics of Bark Beetles","Bark Beetles: Biology and Ecology of Native and Invasive Species","978-0-12-417156-5","","","","Large bark beetle outbreaks are regarded as major forest disturbances, ranking first in the USA before hurricanes, tornadoes, and fire, with a 20,400,000ha average annual impact area and annual average costs (shared with pathogens) above US$2 billion per year. In Europe, over the period 1950-2000, insect damage (which equates mostly to bark beetles) ranked third, with 8% of the total damage due to forest disturbances. The damage amounted to 2.88 million m3 per year between 1958 and 2001. The major direct economic consequences of these outbreaks have been widely analyzed, various mitigation methods have been designed and implemented, and diverse political, industrial, and commercial initiatives have been developed to salvage the remains of the devastated forests. However, the many other environmental and sociological consequences of these disturbances are still largely unexplored. Significant progress has been made in analyzing the multi-scale positive influence of bark beetle activity, from the landscape to the stand level, as well as the various socioeconomic changes brought by bark beetle outbreaks. Silvicultural, environmental, and social consequences of bark beetle outbreaks are described and discussed, as well as the different issues related to the salvage of damaged forests. The wider context of management policies, including risk management and exotic species management, is discussed. Five case studies are presented to illustrate how biological features of specific systems lead to particular sociopolitical issues: Ips typographus in Europe; secondary ambrosia beetles attacking living beech in Europe; Dendroctonus rufipennis in Alaska; Dendroctonus ponderosae in British Columbia; and Ips pini in North America.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2021-06-29 09:49:46","","585-613","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier Inc.","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Bark beetle; Damage; Environmental services; Exotic species; Généralités; RISK; Salvage; Scolytinae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
