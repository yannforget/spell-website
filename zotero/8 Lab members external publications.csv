We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/DQ83XWI5/Lambin et al. - 2010 - Pathogenic landscapes Interactions between land, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the potential teratogenic effects of Wēnzhōu infection on the development of a Murid rodent, Rattus exulans. Using direct virus detection, morphological records and comparative analyses, a link was demonstrated between host infection status and host morphologies (the spleen irrespective of weight, the skull shape and the cranial cavity volume) at the level of the individual (females only). This study demonstrates that mammarenavirus infections can impact natural host physiology and/or affect developmental processes. The presence of an infecting micro-parasite during the development of the rat may lead to a physiological trade-off between immunity and brain size. Alternatively, replication of virus in specialized organs can result in selective morphologic abnormalities and lesions.","2017-05","2018-03-20 10:48:40","2018-03-20 10:48:41","2018-03-20 10:48:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/TQHXRH3V/Artois et al. - 2017 - Effects of mammarenavirus infection (Wēnzhōu virus.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study integrated parasitological and ancient DNA methods with a large sample set dating between Neolithic and Early Modern periods to explore the utility of molecular archaeoparasitology as a new approach to study the past. Molecular analyses provided unequivocal species-level parasite identification and revealed location-specific epidemiological signatures. Faecal–oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were ubiquitous across time and space. By contrast, high numbers of food-associated cestodes (Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata) were restricted to medieval Lübeck. The presence of these cestodes and changes in their prevalence at approximately 1300 CE indicate substantial alterations in diet or parasite availability. Trichuris trichiura ITS-1 sequences grouped into two clades; one ubiquitous and one restricted to medieval Lübeck and Bristol. The high sequence diversity of T.t.ITS-1 detected in Lübeck is consistent with its importance as a Hanseatic trading centre. Collectively, these results introduce molecular archaeoparasitology as an artefact-independent source of historical evidence.","2018","2018-10-06 18:36:13","2018-10-06 18:36:13","","","","1888","285","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
