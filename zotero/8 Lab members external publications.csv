We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This diversity is unevenly distributed across the species range, delimiting genetic diversity hotspots (GDH). Focusing conservation efforts on regions where GDH of several species overlap (i.e., multispecies GDH) could rationalize conservation efforts by protecting several taxa in one go. However, recent studies suggest the existence of many species-specific GDH. This would make spatially prioritizing protection even more challenging as it requires the integration of these multiple GDH rather than few hotspots into conservation planning. Here, we characterize GDH of nine co-distributed bee species through an original comparative mapping approach to assess the suitability of a spatial prioritization strategy to protect their genetic diversity. Location We studied bee populations from Europe. Methods First, we used a sliding window approach to estimate the nucleotide diversity and its geographic distribution to highlight GDH of each species. Second, we assessed the overlap of GDH between species by generating consensus maps based on the species-specific maps of nucleotide diversity. Third, we used the GDH distribution patterns to identify the extent of cost-effective area network that would be needed to protect genetic diversity of all nine species. Results Genetic diversity was unevenly distributed across species ranges, but we found no evidence of a large overlap among GDH from all species. Cost-effective area network needed to protect genetic diversity of all species spreads over several large geographic areas including regions under high human development pressures. Main conclusions Genetic diversity hotspots' location is species-specific. Therefore, focusing conservation efforts strictly on the few regions harbouring GDH for many bee species is unlikely to be sufficient to ensure long-term persistence of all species. Conservation actions should be implemented simultaneously in different regions according to a complementary-based conservation approach, to optimize the conservation of all bee diversity.","2018","2019-09-09 18:38:50","2021-06-29 08:43:31","","1860-1868","","12","24","","","Divergent geographic patterns of genetic diversity among wild bees","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endemic pathogens that infect an individual in the ﬁrst years of life, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating or ameliorating morbidity and mortality. Pathogen associations are ubiquitous but poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. We report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found signiﬁcant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identiﬁed both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens.

This study tests the potential teratogenic effects of Wēnzhōu infection on the development of a Murid rodent, Rattus exulans. Using direct virus detection, morphological records and comparative analyses, a link was demonstrated between host infection status and host morphologies (the spleen irrespective of weight, the skull shape and the cranial cavity volume) at the level of the individual (females only). This study demonstrates that mammarenavirus infections can impact natural host physiology and/or affect developmental processes. The presence of an infecting micro-parasite during the development of the rat may lead to a physiological trade-off between immunity and brain size. Alternatively, replication of virus in specialized organs can result in selective morphologic abnormalities and lesions.","2017-05","2018-03-20 10:48:40","2018-03-20 10:48:41","2018-03-20 10:48:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.","2017-10-11","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2021-06-29 08:30:15","2018-11-07 13:34:07","20170919","","1864","284","","Proc.

This study integrated parasitological and ancient DNA methods with a large sample set dating between Neolithic and Early Modern periods to explore the utility of molecular archaeoparasitology as a new approach to study the past. Molecular analyses provided unequivocal species-level parasite identification and revealed location-specific epidemiological signatures. Faecal–oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were ubiquitous across time and space. By contrast, high numbers of food-associated cestodes (Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata) were restricted to medieval Lübeck. The presence of these cestodes and changes in their prevalence at approximately 1300 CE indicate substantial alterations in diet or parasite availability. Trichuris trichiura ITS-1 sequences grouped into two clades; one ubiquitous and one restricted to medieval Lübeck and Bristol. The high sequence diversity of T.t.ITS-1 detected in Lübeck is consistent with its importance as a Hanseatic trading centre. Collectively, these results introduce molecular archaeoparasitology as an artefact-independent source of historical evidence.","2018","2018-10-06 18:36:13","2018-10-06 18:36:13","","","","1888","285","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The found relationships led us to pursue a third goal: (3) use temporal dynamics in woody cover to estimate potential woody cover. Location Sub-Saharan African savannas. Methods The study used very high spatial resolution satellite imagery at sites with overlapping older (2002–2006) and newer (2011–2016) imagery to estimate change in woody cover. We sampled 596 sites in 38 separate areas across African savannas. Areas with high anthropogenic impact were avoided in order to more clearly identify the influence of environmental factors. Relationships between woody cover change and potential drivers were identified using linear regression and simultaneous autoregression, where the latter accounts for spatial autocorrelation. Results The mean annual change in woody cover across our study areas was 0.25% per year. Although we cannot explain the general trend of encroachment based on our data, we found that change rates were positively correlated with the difference between potential woody cover and actual woody cover (a proxy for water availability; p < .001), and negatively correlated with fire frequency (p < .01). Using the relationship between rates of encroachment and initial cover, we estimated potential woody cover at different rainfall levels. Main conclusions The results indicate that woody encroachment is ongoing and widespread across African savannas. The fact that the difference between potential and actual cover was the most significant predictor highlights the central role of water availability and tree–tree competition in controlling change in woody populations, both in water-limited and mesic savannas. Our approach to derive potential woody cover from the woody cover change trajectories demonstrates that temporal dynamics in woody populations can be used to infer resource limitations.","2018","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","1209-1218","","6","45","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors.

We anticipate that woody canopy cover, crown density, crown size, and the level of spatial aggregation among woody plants in the landscape will vary across environmental gradients. A high level of woody plant aggregation is most distinct in periodic vegetation patterns (PVPs), which emerge as a result of ecohydrological processes such as runoff generation and increased infiltration close to plants. Similar, albeit weaker, forces may influence the spatial distribution of woody plants elsewhere in savannas. Exploring these trends can extend our knowledge of how semi-arid vegetation structure is constrained by rainfall regime, soil type, topography, and disturbance processes such as fire. Using high-spatial-resolution imagery, a flexible classification framework, and a crown delineation method, we extracted woody vegetation properties from 876 sites spread over African savannas. At each site, we estimated woody cover, mean crown size, crown density, and the degree of aggregation among woody plants. This enabled us to elucidate the effects of rainfall regimes (MAP and seasonality), soil texture, slope, and fire frequency on woody vegetation properties. We found that previously documented increases in woody cover with rainfall is more consistently a result of increasing crown size than increasing density of woody plants.

We also found a unimodal relationship between mean crown size and sand content suggesting that maximal savanna tree sizes do not occur in either coarse sands or heavy clays. When examining the occurrence of PVPs, we found that the same factors that contribute to the formation of PVPs also correlate with higher levels of woody plant aggregation elsewhere in savannas and that rainfall seasonality plays a key role for the underlying processes.</p>","2017-07-10","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","3239-3252","","13","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.biogeosciences.net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiological agents are spirochete bacteria that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.) complex and are transmitted by hard ticks among a large range of vertebrate hosts. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector. In the absence of a vaccine and given the current difficulties to diagnose and treat chronic Lyme syndromes, there is urgent need for prevention. In this context, accurate information on the spatial patterns of risk of exposure to ticks is of prime importance for public health. The objective of our study was to provide a snapshot map of the risk of human infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. pathogens in a periurban forest at a high resolution, and to analyze the factors that contribute to variation in this risk. Field monitoring took place over three weeks in May 2011 in the suburban Sénart forest (3,200ha; southeast of Paris), which receives over 3 million people annually. We sampled ticks over the entire forest area (from 220 forest stands with a total area of 35,200m(2)) and quantified the density of questing nymphs (DON), the prevalence of infection among nymphs (NIP), and the density of infected nymphs (DIN), which is the most important predictor of the human risk of Lyme borreliosis. For each of these response variables, we explored the relative roles of weather (saturation deficit), hosts (abundance indices of ungulates and Tamias sibiricus, an introduced rodent species), vegetation and forest cover, superficial soil composition, and the distance to forest roads. In total, 19,546 questing nymphs were collected and the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. was tested in 3,903 nymphs by qPCR. The mean DON was 5.6 nymphs per 10m(2) (standard deviation=10.4) with an average NIP of 10.1% (standard deviation=0.11). The highest DIN was 8.9 infected nymphs per 10m(2), with a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation=0.6). Our mapping and modeling revealed a strong heterogeneity of risk within the forest. The highest risk was found in the eastern part of the forest and localized patches in the northwestern part. Lyme borreliosis risk was positively associated with stands of deciduous trees (mainly oaks) and roe deer abundance. Contrary to expectations, DIN actually increased with distance from the point of introduction of T. sibiricus (i.e., DIN was higher in areas with potentially lower abundances of T. sibiricus). Thus, despite the fact that T. sibiricus is an important reservoir host for B. burgdorferi s. l., our study found that other explanatory factors played a more important role in determining the density of infected ticks. Precise mapping of the risk of exposure to Lyme borreliosis in a highly visited forest represents an important tool for targeting prevention and control measures, as well as making the general public and local health officials aware of the risks.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:19","2019-01-16 13:40:19","","644-652","","5","7","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26897396","","","","","Animals; Humans; Population Density; Ixodes ricinus; Forests; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Acarological risk map; Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Paris; Risk Assessment; Sciuridae; Tick density; Tick infection prevalence; Ticks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disentangling transmission patterns in such systems is often challenging, yet investigating how different host species contribute to transmission is crucial to properly assess and manage disease risk. We aim to reveal transmission cycles of bacteria within the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, which include Lyme disease agents. We characterized Borrelia genotypes found in 488 infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs collected in the Sénart Forest located near Paris (France). These genotypes were compared to those observed in three sympatric species of small mammals and network analyses reveal four independent transmission cycles. Statistical modelling shows that two cycles involving chipmunks, an introduced species, and non-sampled host species such as birds, are responsible for the majority of tick infections. In contrast, the cycle involving native bank voles only accounts for a small proportion of infected ticks. Genotypes associated with the two primary transmission cycles were isolated from Lyme disease patients, confirming the epidemiological threat posed by these strains. Our work demonstrates that combining high-throughput sequence typing with networks tools and statistical modeling is a promising approach for characterizing transmission cycles of multi-host pathogens in complex ecological settings.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:06","2019-01-16 13:40:06","","31273","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27498685 PMCID: PMC4976386","","","","","Phylogeny; Animals; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Humans; Zoonoses; Ecology; Forests; Birds; Disease Reservoirs; Genotype; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; France; Introduced Species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features make the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex an attractive biological model that can be used to study the diversification and the epidemiology of endemic bacterial pathogens. We investigated the potential of population genomic approaches to study these processes. Sixty-three strains belonging to three species within the Borrelia burgdorferi complex were isolated from questing ticks in Alsace (France), a region where Lyme disease is highly endemic. We first aimed to characterize the degree of genetic isolation among the species sampled. Phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses revealed clear delineations: there was a ∼50 fold difference between intra-specific and inter-specific recombination rates. We then investigated whether the population genomic data contained information of epidemiological relevance. In phylogenies inferred using most of the genome, conspecific strains did not cluster in clades. These results raise questions about the relevance of different strategies when investigating pathogen epidemiology. For instance, here, both classical analytic approaches and phylodynamic simulations suggested that population sizes and migration rates were higher in B. garinii populations, which are normally associated with birds, than in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations. The phylogenetic analyses of the infection-related ospC gene and its flanking region provided additional support for this finding. Traces of recombination among the B. burgdorferi s.s. lineages and lineages associated with small mammals were found, suggesting that they shared the same hosts. Altogether, these results provide baseline evidence that can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the host range of B. burgdorferi lineages based on population genomic data.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:51","2021-07-02 11:20:48","","e94384","","4","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24721934 PMCID: PMC3993988","","","","","Phylogeny; Genetic Variation; Animals; Humans; Host Specificity; Birds; Mammals; Disease Vectors; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Lyme Disease; Ticks; France; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Genome, Bacterial; Metagenomics; Reproductive Isolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an epidemiological perspective, it is important to determine whether genetic variants within the species complex are able to spread freely through the whole host community or, instead, if certain variants are restricted to particular hosts. To this end, we characterized the genotypes of members of the B. burgdorferi species complex; the bacteria were isolated from more than two hundred individuals captured in the wild and belonging to three different rodent host species. For each individual, we used a high-throughput approach to amplify and sequence rplB, a housekeeping gene, and ospC, which is involved in infection. This approach allowed us to evaluate the genetic diversity both within and among species in the B. burgdorferi species complex. Strong evidence of genetic differentiation among host species was revealed by both genes, even though they are, a priori, not constrained by the same selective pressures. These data are discussed in the context of the advancements made possible by multi-locus high-throughput sequencing and current knowledge of Lyme disease epidemiology.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:30","2021-07-02 11:20:42","","e88581","","2","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24533116 PMCID: PMC3922933","","","","","Phylogeny; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Genetic Variation; Algorithms; Animals; Host Specificity; Sequence Alignment; Mice; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Genotype; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; Antigens, Bacterial; Arvicolinae; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we apply both phylodynamic and phylogenetic community ecology techniques to examine the consequences of pathogen heterogeneity on transmission by assessing subtype-specific transmission pathways in a social carnivore. We use comprehensive social and spatial network data to examine transmission pathways for three subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle ) in African lions (Panthera leo) at multiple scales in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used FIVPle molecular data to examine the role of social organization and lion density in shaping transmission pathways and tested to what extent vertical (i.e., father- and/or mother-offspring relationships) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) transmission underpinned these patterns for each subtype. Using the same data, we constructed subtype-specific FIVPle co-occurrence networks and assessed what combination of social networks, spatial networks or co-infection best structured the FIVPle network. While social organization (i.e., pride) was an important component of FIVPle transmission pathways at all scales, we find that FIVPle subtypes exhibited different transmission pathways at within- and between-pride scales. A combination of social and spatial networks, coupled with consideration of subtype co-infection, was likely to be important for FIVPle transmission for the two major subtypes, but the relative contribution of each factor was strongly subtype-specific. Our study provides evidence that pathogen heterogeneity is important in understanding pathogen transmission, which could have consequences for how endemic pathogens are managed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community phylogenetic ecology coupled with phylodynamic techniques can reveal insights into the differential evolutionary pressures acting on virus subtypes, which can manifest into landscape-level effects.","2017","2019-01-16 13:38:25","2019-01-16 13:38:25","","1469-1482","","6","86","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28884827","","","","","Phylogeny; Animals; community ecology; Coinfection; feline immunodeficiency virus; generalized dissimilarity modelling; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; landscape ecology; Lentivirus Infections; Lions; OTU networks; phylogenetic diversity; Social Behavior; social systems; Tanzania; transmission mode; wildlife disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four spatially explicit local scenarios are built each including a narrative, two future land cover maps up to 2040 and 2100, and a set of quantified LULCC. Scenarios are then used to identify areas likely to encounter land cover changes (deforestation, reforestation, and encroachment) prone to affect gravitational hazards. In order to demonstrate their interest for decision-making, future land cover maps are used as input to a landslide hazard assessment model. Results highlight that reforestation will continue to be a major trend in all scenarios and confirm that the approach improves the accuracy of landslide hazard computations.

Triatomine sampling was performed in two municipalities of Casanare, Colombia, specifically in the intersection of riparian forests and oil palm plantations. For R. prolixus abundance per palm, the predictors showing more relationship were palm species and blood meal species identified in the palm, and for T. cruzi infection per triatomine, they were palm species and nymphal stage. Palm microclimate was very similar in both palm species and did not show a relationship with triatomine abundance. Comparing palm species, A. butyracea showed more blood meal species, including more refractory host species, than E. guineensis, but lower T. cruzi infection rate and parasitaemia. Interestingly, non-arboreal blood meal species were frequently found in the analyzed nymphs, indicating that the blood source for R. prolixus in palms corresponded to all the fauna located in the surrounded landscape and not only in the palm.

Nonetheless, identifying routes of disease transmission within a population, and determining the key groups of individuals that drive parasite transmission and maintenance, are fundamental to understanding disease dynamics. Gammaherpesviruses are a widespread group of DNA viruses that infect many vertebrate species, and murine gammaherpesviruses (i.e. MuHV-4) are a standard lab model for studying human herpesviruses, for which much about the pathology and immune response elicited to infection is well understood. However, despite this extensive research effort, primarily in the lab, the transmission route of murine gammaherpesviruses within their natural host populations is not well understood. Here, we aimed to understand wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV) transmission, by fitting a series of population dynamic models to field data on wood mice naturally infected with WMHV and then estimating transmission parameters within and between demographic groups of the host population. Different models accounted for different combinations of host sex (male/female), age (subadult/adult) and transmission functions (density/frequency-dependent). We found that a density-dependent transmission model incorporating explicit sex groups fitted the data better than all other proposed models. Male-to-male transmission was the highest among all possible combinations of between- and within-sex transmission classes, suggesting that male behaviour is a key factor driving WMHV transmission. Our models also suggest that transmission between sexes, although important, wasn’t symmetrical, with infected males playing a significant role in infecting naïve females but not vice versa. Overall this work shows the power of coupling population dynamic models with long-term field data to elucidate otherwise unobservable transmission processes in wild disease systems.","2021-06-01","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:13:19","100451","","","35","","Epidemics","Who acquires infection from whom?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Disease ecology; Disease transmission; Host classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many factors have contributed to shifts in the disease distribution and eco epidemiological outcomes, resulting in the emergence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreaks and the incrimination of vectors in unreported regions. New research development is vital for establishing the new paradigms of the present transmission cycles, hoping to facilitate new control strategies to reduce parasite transmission. Hereafter, this work aims to model and infer the current transmission cycles of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia defined by vector and mammal species distributed and interacting in the different regions and validate them by performing sand fly and mammal collections. Vector-host co-occurrences were computed considering five ecoregions of the Colombian territory defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and downloaded from The Nature Conservancy TNC Maps website. Four validation sites were selected based on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis prevalence reports. Sand flies and mammals captured in the field were processed, and species were defined using conventional taxonomic guidelines. Detection of infection by Leishmania was performed to identify transmission cycles in the selected areas. This study uses predictive models based on available information from international gazetteers and fieldwork to confirm sand fly and mammalian species' sustaining Leishmania transmission cycles. Our results show an uneven distribution of mammal samples in Colombia, possibly due to sampling bias, since only two departments contributed 50% of the available samples. Bats were the vertebrates with the highest score values, suggesting substantial spatial overlap with sand flies than the rest of the vertebrates evaluated. Fieldwork allowed identifying three circulating Leishmania species, isolated from three sand fly species. In the Montane Forest ecosystem, one small marsupial, Gracilinanus marica, was found infected with Leishmania panamensis, constituting the first record of this species infected with Leishmania. In the same locality, an infected sand fly, Pintomyia pia, was found. The overall results could support the understanding of the current transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Colombia.","2021-03-24","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:14:17","6789","","1","11","","Sci.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the population densities and relative abundance of triatomines and mammals that may be involved in the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease to clarify the epidemiological scenario in an endemic area in the province of Casanare. Insect vectors on Attalea butyracea palms were captured using both manual searches and bait traps. The capture of mammals was performed using Sherman and Tomahawk traps. We report an infestation index of 88.5% in 148 palms and an index of T. cruzi natural infection of 60.2% in 269 dissected insects and 11.9% in 160 captured mammals. High population densities of triatomines were observed in the sylvatic environment and there was a high relative abundance of reservoirs in the area, suggesting a stable enzootic cycle.

While DVGs have been described for most viruses, identifying which, if any, can be used as therapeutic agents remains a challenge. We present a combined experimental evolution and computational approach to triage DVG sequence space and pinpoint the fittest deletions, using Zika virus as an arbovirus model. This approach identifies fit DVGs that optimally interfere with wild-type virus infection. We show that the most fit DVGs conserve the open reading frame to maintain the translation of the remaining non-structural proteins, a characteristic that is fundamental across the flavivirus genus. Finally, we demonstrate that the high fitness DVG is antiviral in vivo both in the mammalian host and the mosquito vector, reducing transmission in the latter by up to 90%. Our approach establishes the method to interrogate the DVG fitness landscape, and enables the systematic identification of DVGs that show promise as human therapeutics and vector control strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission and disease.","2021-04-16","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:12:56","2290","","1","12","","Nat.

The study of agricultural product flows can provide insights on the complex interactions between exporting and importing countries and the resulting network structures. Commercial partnerships between countries can be modelled using a complex network approach. Based on the detailed trade matrices from FAO covering the period from 1986 to 2013, we present an analysis of the world cereal trade in terms of weighted and directed networks. The network nodes are the countries and the links are the trades of agricultural products in mass. We reveal the changing topology and degree distribution of the world network during the studied period. We distinguish three entangled subnetwork structures when considering the temporal stability of the trades. The three subnetworks display distinct properties and a differential contribution in total trade. Trades of uninterrupted activity over the 28-year study period compose the backbone network which accounts for two thirds of all traded mass and is scale-free. Inversely, two thirds of the trades only have one or two consecutive years of activity and define the transient subnetwork which displays random growth and accounts for very little traded mass. The trades of intermediate duration display an exponential growth both in numbers and in traded mass and define the intermediate subnetwork. The topology of each subnetwork is a time invariant. The identification of invariant structures is a useful basis for developing prospective agri-food network modelling to assess their resilience to perturbations and shocks.","2019","2021-09-27 13:36:55","2021-09-27 13:36:55","2021-09-27 13:36:12","e0216318","","5","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Europe; Network analysis; Centrality; Clustering coefficients; Exponential functions; Food; Geopolitics; Scale-free networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viral evolutionary studies frequently adopt an uncorrelated clock model as a generic relaxed molecular clock process, but this may impose considerable estimation bias if discrete rate variation exists among clades or lineages. For HIV-1 group M, rate variation among subtypes has been shown to result in inconsistencies in time to the most recent common ancestor estimation. Although this calls into question the adequacy of available molecular dating methods, no solution to this problem has been offered so far. Here, we investigate the use of mixed effects molecular clock models, which combine both fixed and random effects in the evolutionary rate, to estimate divergence times. Using simulation, we demonstrate that this model outperforms existing molecular clock models in a Bayesian framework for estimating time-measured phylogenies in the presence of mixed sources of rate variation, while also maintaining good performance in simpler scenarios. By analysing a comprehensive HIV-1 group M complete genome data set we confirm considerable rate variation among subtypes that is not adequately modelled by uncorrelated relaxed clock models. The mixed effects clock model can accommodate this rate variation and results in a time to the most recent common ancestor of HIV-1 group M of 1920 (1915–25), which is only slightly earlier than the uncorrelated relaxed clock estimate for the same data set. The use of complete genome data appears to have a more profound impact than the molecular clock model because it reduces the credible intervals by 50 per cent relative to similar estimates based on short envelope gene sequences.","2019-07-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:24:48","","","2","5","","","Divergence dating using mixed effects clock modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In early 2020, Cyprus, among other European countries, was affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and adopted lockdown measures in March 2020 to limit the initial outbreak on the island. In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021). Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein (L18F, ΔH69/V70, S898F, ΔY144, S162G, A222V, N439K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A and D1118H) that confer higher transmissibility and/or antibody escape (immune evasion) upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom (UK), although many other regions/countries were identified (southeastern Asia, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the USA, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Pakistan). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries, resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island.","2021-06-09","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1098","","6","13","","Viruses","A Comprehensive Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34207490 PMCID: PMC8227210","","","","","Genome, Viral; Phylogeny; Mutation; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Phylogeography; molecular epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Communicable Disease Control; RNA, Viral; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19; Cyprus; Nasopharynx","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assay consists of three partially overlapping PCRs followed by Sanger population or Illumina next-generation sequencing. Seventy-seven therapy-naïve samples, spanning the entire diversity range of currently known HCV1b, were used for optimization of PCRs, of which ten were sequenced using Sanger and of these ten, four using Illumina. The median detection limits for the three regions, 5'UTR-NS2, E2-NS5A and NS4B-NS5B, were 570, 5670 and 56,670 IU/ml respectively. The number of Illumina reads mapped varied according to the software used, Segminator II being the best performing (81%). Consensus Illumina and Sanger sequencing results accord largely (0.013% major discordances). Differences were due almost exclusively to a larger number of ambiguities (presumably minority variants) scored by Illumina (1.50% minor discordances). The assay is easy to perform in an equipped laboratory; nevertheless, it was difficult to reach high sensitivity and reproducibility, due to the high genetic viral variability. This assay proved to be suitable for detecting drug resistance mutations and can also be used for epidemiological research, even though only a limited set of samples was used for validation.","2014-12","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","126-135","","","209","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25245140","","","","","Sequence Analysis, DNA; Humans; Illumina; NGS; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Antiviral Agents; Sensitivity and Specificity; Reproducibility of Results; Genotyping; Drug resistance; Drug Resistance, Viral; Full-genome sequencing; Genotyping Techniques; HCV1b; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Microbial Sensitivity Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A second objective of this study was to analyze associations between vaccine-specific immune responses and epitope mutation rates. DESIGN: HIV-1-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were subjected to immunotherapy by the administration of an autologous dendritic cell-based therapeutic vaccine expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef and subsequent ATI. METHODS: HIV-1 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA obtained before initiation of cART as well as during ATI. Control sequences for virus evolution in untreated HIV-1-infected individuals were obtained from the HIV Sequence Database (Los Alamos). CD8 T-cell epitope regions were defined based on literature data and prediction models. HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated to analyze their impact on sequence evolution. RESULTS: Viral sequence evolution in the tat, rev, and nef genes of vaccinated patients was similar to that of controls. The number of mutations observed inside and outside CD8 T-cell epitopes was comparable for vaccine-targeted and nontargeted proteins. We found no evidence for an impact of vaccine-induced or enhanced immune responses on the number of mutations inside or outside epitopes.

Little is known about the safety of ATI and its long-term impact on patient health. OBJECTIVES: ATI safety was assessed and potential biomarkers predicting viral rebound were evaluated. METHODS: PBMCs, plasma and CSF were collected from 11 HIV-1-positive individuals at four different timepoints during ATI (NCT02641756). Total and integrated HIV-1 DNA, cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 RNA transcripts and restriction factor (RF) expression were measured by PCR-based assays. Markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury [neurofilament light chain (NFL) and YKL-40 protein] were measured in CSF. Additionally, neopterin, tryptophan and kynurenine were measured, both in plasma and CSF, as markers of immune activation. RESULTS: Total HIV-1 DNA, integrated HIV-1 DNA and CA viral RNA transcripts did not differ pre- and post-ATI. Similarly, no significant NFL or YKL-40 increases in CSF were observed between baseline and viral rebound. Furthermore, markers of immune activation did not increase during ATI. Interestingly, the RFs SLFN11 and APOBEC3G increased after ATI before viral rebound. Similarly, Tat-Rev transcripts were increased preceding viral rebound after interruption. CONCLUSIONS: ATI did not increase viral reservoir size and it did not reveal signs of increased neuronal injury or inflammation, suggesting that these well-monitored ATIs are safe. Elevation of Tat-Rev transcription and induced expression of the RFs SLFN11 and APOBEC3G after ATI, prior to viral rebound, indicates that these factors could be used as potential biomarkers predicting viral rebound.","2020-05-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1311-1320","","5","75","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32053203 PMCID: PMC7869780","","","","","Humans; HIV-1; RNA, Viral; HIV Infections; APOBEC-3G Deaminase; Biomarkers; Nuclear Proteins; Viral Load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have mainly focused on the capital cities of Brazilian federal states, and the fact that HIV-1C infections increase at a higher rate than subtype B infections in Brazil calls for a better understanding of the process of spatial spread. A comprehensive sequence data set sampled across 22 Brazilian locations was assembled and analyzed. A Bayesian phylogeographic generalized linear model approach was used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of HIV-1C in Brazil, considering several potential explanatory predictors of the viral diffusion process. Analyses were performed on several subsampled data sets in order to mitigate potential sample biases. We reveal a central role for the city of Porto Alegre, the capital of the southernmost state, in the Brazilian HIV-1C epidemic (HIV-1C_BR), and the northward expansion of HIV-1C_BR could be linked to source populations with higher HIV-1 burdens and larger proportions of HIV-1C infections. The results presented here bring new insights to the continuing discussion about the HIV-1C epidemic in Brazil and raise an alternative hypothesis for its spatiotemporal history. The current work also highlights how sampling bias can confound phylogeographic analyses and demonstrates the importance of incorporating external information to protect against this. IMPORTANCE: Subtype C is responsible for the largest HIV infection burden worldwide, but our understanding of its transmission dynamics remains incomplete. Brazil witnessed a relatively recent introduction of HIV-1C compared to HIV-1B, but it swiftly spread throughout the south, where it now circulates as the dominant variant. The northward spread has been comparatively slow, and HIV-1B still prevails in that region. While epidemiological data and viral genetic analyses have both independently shed light on the dynamics of spread in isolation, their combination has not yet been explored. Here, we complement publically available sequences and new genetic data from 13 cities with epidemiological data to reconstruct the history of HIV-1C spread in Brazil. The combined approach results in more robust reconstructions and can protect against sampling bias. We found evidence for an alternative view of the HIV-1C spatiotemporal history in Brazil that, contrary to previous explanations, integrates seamlessly with other observational data.","2015-12","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","12341-12348","","24","89","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26423943 PMCID: PMC4665240","","","","","Phylogeny; Humans; Phylogeography; Female; HIV-1; Male; HIV Infections; Brazil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice.

Of these antigenically distinct viruses, the H3N2 virus was consistently detected in substantial proportions in Korea during the 2010/11-2013/14 seasons when compared to the other viruses and appeared responsible for the influenza-like illness rate peak during the first half of the 2011/12 season. To further scrutinize possible causes for this, we investigated the evolutionary and serological relationships between the vaccine and Korean H3N2 strains during the 2011/12 season for the main antigenic determinants of influenza viruses, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. In the 2011/12 season, when the number of H3N2 cases peaked, the majority of the Korean strains did not belong to the HA clade of A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine, and no Korean strains were of this lineage in the NA segment. In a serological assay, post-vaccinated human sera exhibited much reduced hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against the non-vaccine clade Korean H3N2 strains. Moreover, Korean strains harbored several amino acid differences in the HA antigenic sites and in the NA with respect to vaccine lineages during this season. Of these, the HA antigenic site C residues 45 and 261 and the NA residue 81 appeared to be the signatures of positive selection. In subsequent seasons, when H3N2 cases were lower, the HA and NA genes of vaccine and Korean strains were more phylogenetically related to each other. Combined, our results provide indirect support for using phylogenetic clustering patterns of the HA and possibly also the NA genes in the selection of vaccine viruses and the assessment of vaccine effectiveness.","2017-03-03","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:55:19","e0172059","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Phylogenetics; Influenza; Evolutionary genetics; Influenza viruses; Viral evolution; Antigens; Hemagglutination inhibition test; Viral vaccines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly susceptible AG129 mice were used to allow for a maximal/unlimited expansion of the viral populations. Infected mice uniformly developed neurotropic disease; the virus was isolated from their brains, plaque purified and sequenced. Viral RNA populations were overall rather homogenous [Shannon entropies 0-0.15]. The remaining, yet limited intra-host population diversity (0-11 nucleotide exchanges per genome) appeared to be a consequence of pre-existing clonal heterogeneities (quasispecies) of Stamaril®. In parallel, mice were infected with a molecular clone of YFV-17D which was in vivo launched from a plasmid. Such plasmid-launched YFV-17D had a further reduced and almost clonal evolution. The limited intra-host evolution during unrestricted expansion in a highly susceptible host is relevant for vaccine and drug development against flaviviruses in general. Firstly, a propensity for limited evolution even upon infection with a (very) low inoculum suggests that fractional dosing as implemented in current YF-outbreak control may pose only a limited risk of reversion to pathogenic vaccine-derived virus variants. Secondly, it also largely lowers the chance of antigenic drift and development of resistance to antivirals.","2019","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1734-1746","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31797751 PMCID: PMC6896426","","","","","Genetic Variation; Animals; Plasmids; Evolution, Molecular; Mice; Brain; Antibodies, Viral; Yellow fever virus; Disease Models, Animal; fractional dosing; intra-host evolution; live-attenuated vaccine; virus diversity; Yellow Fever; Yellow Fever Vaccine; YFV-17D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2015, the field of RSV molecular epidemiology has evolved rapidly with around 20-30 published articles per year. The objective of this systematic review is to identify knowledge gaps in recent RSV genetic literature to guide global molecular epidemiology research. We included 78 studies published between 2015 and 2020 describing 12,998 RSV sequences of which 8,233 (63%) have been uploaded to GenBank. Seventeen (22%) studies were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and seven (9%) studies sequenced whole-genomes. Although most reported polymorphisms for monoclonal antibodies in clinical development (nirsevimab, MK-1654) have not been tested for resistance in neutralisation essays, known resistance was detected at low levels for the nirsevimab and palivizumab binding site. High resistance was found for the suptavumab binding site. We present the first literature review of an enormous amount of RSV genetic data. The need for global monitoring of RSV molecular epidemiology becomes increasingly important in evaluating the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody candidates as they reach their final stages of clinical development. We have identified the following three knowledge gaps: whole-genome data to study global RSV evolution, data from LMICs and data from global surveillance programs.","2021-09-20","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","e2284","","","","","","A systematic review on global RSV genetic data","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34543489","","","","","molecular epidemiology; monoclonal antibodies; respiratory syncytial virus; RSV; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Spain, ongoing transmission of HCV is mostly fuelled by people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with subtype 1a (HCV1a). Aim Our aim was to map how infections spread within and between populations, which could help formulate more effective intervention programmes to halt the HCV1a epidemic in Spain. Methods Epidemiological links between HCV1a viruses from a convenience sample of 283 patients in Spain, mostly PWID, collected between 2014 and 2016, and 1,317, 1,291 and 1,009 samples collected abroad between 1989 and 2016 were reconstructed using sequences covering the NS3, NS5A and NS5B genes. To efficiently do so, fast maximum likelihood-based tree estimation was coupled to a flexible Bayesian discrete phylogeographic inference method. Results The transmission network structure of the Spanish HCV1a epidemic was shaped by continuous seeding of HCV1a into Spain, almost exclusively from North America and European countries. The latter became increasingly relevant and have dominated in recent times. Export from Spain to other countries in Europe was also strongly supported, although Spain was a net sink for European HCV1a lineages. Spatial reconstructions showed that the epidemic in Spain is diffuse, without large, dominant within-country networks. Conclusion To boost the effectiveness of local intervention efforts, concerted supra-national strategies to control HCV1a transmission are needed, with a strong focus on the most important drivers of ongoing transmission, i.e. PWID and other high-risk populations.","2019-02-28","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:09:31","1800227","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.eurosurveillance.org","","Publisher: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequences obtained from drug resistance testing were used for subtyping, TDR determination and transmission clusters (TC) analyses. Results In Portugal, transmission of subtype B was significantly associated with young males, while transmission of subtype G was associated with older heterosexuals. In Portuguese originated people, there was a decreasing trend both for prevalence of subtype G and for number of TCs in this subtype. The active TCs that were identified (i.e. clusters originated after 2008) were associated with subtype B-infected males residing in Lisbon. TDR was significantly different when comparing subtypes B (10.8% [9.5–12.2]) and G (7.6% [6.4–9.0]) (p = 0.001).

Here, we report potential evasion strategies of influenza A viruses under in vivo passive anti-M2e IgG immune selection pressure in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. A/Puerto Rico/8/34-infected SCID mice were treated with the M2e-specific mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MAb 65 (IgG2a) or MAb 37 (IgG1), which recognize amino acids 5 to 15 in M2e, or with MAb 148 (IgG1), which binds to the invariant N terminus of M2e. Treatment of challenged SCID mice with any of these MAbs significantly prolonged survival compared to isotype control IgG treatment. Furthermore, M2e-specific IgG2a protected significantly better than IgG1, and even resulted in virus clearance in some of the SCID mice. Deep sequencing analysis of viral RNA isolated at different time points after treatment revealed that the sequence variation in M2e was limited to P10H/L and/or I11T in anti-M2e MAb-treated mice. Remarkably, in half of the samples isolated from moribund MAb 37-treated mice and in all MAb 148-treated mice, virus was isolated with a wild-type M2 sequence but with nonsynonymous mutations in the polymerases and/or the hemagglutinin genes. Some of these mutations were associated with delayed M2 and other viral gene expression and with increased resistance to anti-M2e MAb treatment of SCID mice. Treatment with M2e-specific MAbs thus selects for viruses with limited variation in M2e. Importantly, influenza A viruses may also undergo an alternative escape route by acquiring mutations that result in delayed wild-type M2 expression. IMPORTANCE Broadly protective influenza vaccine candidates may have a higher barrier to immune evasion compared to conventional influenza vaccines. We used Illumina MiSeq deep sequence analysis to study the mutational patterns in A/Puerto Rico/8/34 viruses that evolve in chronically infected SCID mice that were treated with different M2e-specific MAbs. We show that under these circumstances, viruses emerged in vivo with mutations in M2e that were limited to positions 10 and 11. Moreover, we discovered an alternative route for anti-M2e antibody immune escape, in which a virus is selected with wild-type M2e but with mutations in other gene segments that result in delayed M2 and other viral protein expression. Delayed expression of the viral antigen that is targeted by a protective antibody thus represents an influenza virus immune escape mechanism that does not involve epitope alterations.","2021-08-31","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","e0074521","","4","12","","mBio","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34253060 PMCID: PMC8406285","","","","","influenza; deep sequencing; broadly protective; escape; immunotherapy; monoclonal antibodies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These new arteriviruses were discovered in African rodents and were given the names Lopma virus and Praja virus. Their genomes follow the characteristic genome organization of all known arteriviruses, even though they are only distantly related to currently known rodent-borne arteriviruses. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Lopma virus clusters in the subfamily Variarterivirinae, while Praja virus clusters near members of the subfamily Heroarterivirinae: the yet undescribed forest pouched giant rat arterivirus and hedgehog arterivirus 1. A co-divergence analysis of rodent-borne arteriviruses confirms that they share similar phylogenetic patterns with their hosts, with only very few cases of host shifting events throughout their evolutionary history.

Available patient metadata were qualitatively interpreted and correlated with onwards transmission using Fisher exact tests and logistic regression. Most infections were from subtypes A (n=36), B (n=815) and C (n=211). Africa is the dominant origin location for subtypes A and C while the subtype B epidemic was seeded from the USA and Middle America and, from the early 1990s onwards, mostly by interprovincial spread. Subtypes A (77.8%) and C (74.0%) were usually heterosexually transmitted and circulate predominantly among Blacks (61.1% and 85% respectively). Subtype B was mostly found among Caucasians (48.6%) and First Nations (36.8%), and its modes of transmission were stratified by ethnic origin. Compared to subtypes A (5.6%) and C (3.8–10.0%), a larger portion of subtype B patients were found within putative provincial transmission networks (20.3–29.5%), and this almost doubled when focusing on nationwide transmission clusters (37.9–57.5%).

The variation in inoculum size among different risk groups therefore implies that the adaptation rate of HIV may vary between epidemics with different risk group compositions. Furthermore, factors that govern the rate of within-host evolution may also vary by risk group and therefore contribute to evolutionary differences at the epidemic level. Methods We adopted a population genetic approach to test whether the different proportions of multi-variant transmissions are reflected by varying proportions of transmitted diversity between men-having-sex-with-men (MSM), heterosexual (HET) and direct blood contact (BC) sub-populations. To this purpose, we collected all available transmission chain clonal sequence data sets (n = 70) available at the Los Alamos HIV website and through an extensive literature search. To assess evolutionary rate differences among different risk groups, we compiled risk group datasets for several subtypes and directly compared the absolute substitution rate and its synonymous and non-synonymous components. Results There was sufficient demographic signal to inform the transmission model in BEAST using env data to compare the transmission bottleneck size between the MSM and HET risk groups, i.e. the largest contributors to HIV spread. We find no indications for a different proportion of transmitted genetic diversity at the population level between these groups. In the direct rate comparisons between risk groups, however, we consistently recover a higher evolutionary rate in the male dominated risk group compared to the HET datasets. Conclusions We find that the risk group composition impacts the viral evolutionary rate and therefore potentially also the adaptation rate. In particular, risk group-specific sex ratios, and the variation in within-host evolutionary rates between males and females, imposes evolutionary rate differences at the epidemic level, but we cannot exclude a role of varying transmission rates.","2015-07-31","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:43:10","1549-1556","","12","29","","AIDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26244394 PMCID: PMC5348249","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PLoS ONE 5(10), E13564 (2010). The recent commercialization of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about the possibility of characterizing complex viral populations at previously unattainable scales. An important consideration in designing experiments with these technologies is the need for large quantities of input DNA. To accommodate low-input samples, an amplification step is required, usually a PCR, which comes at the risk of introducing a bias that potentially distorts the view of the viral population composition. By implementing a new sample preprocessing protocol, Willerth et al. address these experimental limitations in the context of complete HIV genome sequencing. Moreover, to facilitate the assembly of short and potentially divergent HIV-derived reads, the authors construct a full-length data-specific consensus sequence using a novel bioinformatics approach that capitalizes on the available HIV complete genomes.","2011-04-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:42:04","417-420","","4","6","","","High-throughput HIV sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","futuremedicine.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: Future Medicine","","","","","HIV; deep sequencing; Illumina®; next-generation sequencing; Ovation™ RNA-Seq System; single-molecule sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measures of phylogenetic signal are widely used in ecological and evolutionary research, and are recently gaining traction in viral evolutionary studies. Standard estimators of phylogenetic signal frequently condition on data summary statistics of the repeated trait observations and fixed phylogenetics trees, resulting in information loss and potential bias. To incorporate the observation process and phylogenetic uncertainty in a model-based approach, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to simultaneously estimate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic signal from molecular sequence data and repeated multivariate traits. Our approach builds upon a phylogenetic diffusion framework that model continuous trait evolution as a Brownian motion process and incorporates Pagel's λ transformation parameter to estimate dependence among traits. We provide a computationally efficient inference implementation in the BEAST software package. We evaluate the synthetic performance of the Bayesian estimator of phylogenetic signal against standard estimators, and demonstrate the use of our coherent framework to address several virus-host evolutionary questions, including virulence heritability for HIV, antigenic evolution in influenza and HIV, and Drosophila sensitivity to sigma virus infection. Finally, we discuss model extensions that will make useful contributions to our flexible framework for simultaneously studying sequence and trait evolution.","2015-01-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","67-82","","1","6","","","Simultaneously estimating evolutionary history and repeated traits phylogenetic signal","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25780554 PMCID: PMC4358766","","","","","adaptation; Bayesian phylogenetics; virulence; comparative approach; virus evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of comprehensive direct comparative analyses of the evolutionary processes at different biological scales, our understanding of how fast within-host HIV-1 evolutionary rates translate to lower rates at the between host level remains incomplete. Here, we address this by analyzing pol and env data from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain for which both the timing and the direction is known for most transmission events. To this purpose, we develop a new transmission model in a Bayesian genealogical inference framework and demonstrate how to constrain the viral evolutionary history to be compatible with the transmission history while simultaneously inferring the within-host evolutionary and population dynamics. We show that accommodating a transmission bottleneck affords the best fit our data, but the sparse within-host HIV-1 sampling prevents accurate quantification of the concomitant loss in genetic diversity. We draw inference under the transmission model to estimate HIV-1 evolutionary rates among epidemiologically-related patients and demonstrate that they lie in between fast intra-host rates and lower rates among epidemiologically unrelated individuals infected with HIV subtype C. Using a new molecular clock approach, we quantify and find support for a lower evolutionary rate along branches that accommodate a transmission event or branches that represent the entire backbone of transmitted lineages in our transmission history. Finally, we recover the rate differences at the different biological scales for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, which is only compatible with the ‘store and retrieve’ hypothesis positing that viruses stored early in latently infected cells preferentially transmit or establish new infections upon reactivation.","2014","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:41:15","e1003505","","4","10","","","The Genealogical Population Dynamics of HIV-1 in a Large Transmission Chain","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Phylogenetics; Phylogenetic analysis; HIV; HIV-1; HIV epidemiology; Viral evolution; Evolutionary immunology; Evolutionary rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lin et al. (2015, Journal of Virology, 89/7: 3512–22) recently investigated the evolutionary history of hepatitis B virus in a transmission chain and postulated that the ‘colonization–adaptation–transmission’ model can explain the differential impact of transmission on synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates. Here, we revisit this dataset using a full probabilistic Bayesian phylogenetic framework that adequately accounts for the non-independence of sequence data when estimating evolutionary parameters. Examination of the transmission chain data under a flexible coalescent prior reveals a general inconsistency between the estimated timings and clustering patterns and the known transmission history, highlighting the need to incorporate host transmission information in the analysis. Using an explicit genealogical transmission chain model, we find strong support for a transmission-associated decrease of the overall evolutionary rate. However, in contrast to the initially reported larger transmission effect on non-synonymous substitution rate, we find a similar decrease in both non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates that cannot be adequately explained by the colonization-adaptation-transmission model. An alternative explanation may involve a transmission/establishment advantage of hepatitis B virus variants that have accumulated fewer within-host substitutions, perhaps by spending more time in the covalently closed circular DNA state between each round of viral replication. More generally, this study illustrates that ignoring phylogenetic relationships can lead to misleading evolutionary estimates.","2017-07-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:59:46","","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These efforts have, however, remained largely limited to small genomic regions. The growing need to monitor multiple genome regions for drug resistance testing, as well as the obvious benefit for studying evolutionary and epidemic processes makes complete genome sequencing an important goal in viral research. In addition, a major drawback for NGS applications to RNA viruses is the need for large quantities of input DNA. Here, we use a generic overlapping amplicon-based near full-genome amplification protocol to compare low-input enzymatic fragmentation (Nextera™) with conventional mechanical shearing for Roche 454 sequencing. We find that the fragmentation method has only a modest impact on the characterization of the population composition and that for reliable results, the variation introduced at all steps of the procedure--from nucleic acid extraction to sequencing--should be taken into account, a finding that is also relevant for NGS technologies that are now more commonly used. Furthermore, by applying our protocol to deep sequence a number of pre-therapy plasma and PBMC samples, we illustrate the potential benefits of a near complete genome sequencing approach in routine genotyping.","2016-01-07","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","E12","","1","8","","Viruses","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26751471 PMCID: PMC4728572","","","","","Genome, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; HIV; HIV-1; NGS; HIV Infections; Sequence Analysis, RNA; full genome sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early diagnosis and timely treatment influences the outcome of dengue illness, as delay in care-seeking is significantly associated with complications leading to severe dengue. We aimed to understand patterns of health seeking behaviour (HSB) in individuals exposed to high dengue incidence in order to improve early attendance to health centres. Methods Between September 2013 and February 2014 a cross-sectional household survey was performed in Maracay, Venezuela. Intended HSB of adults and children’s parents/guardians was assessed with respect to fever or suspected dengue. Data was collected through structured questionnaires from 105 individuals. Results Most individuals felt at risk of dengue and believed it could be a deadly disease. In the case of suspected dengue, the majority (60%) would choose to first seek medical help versus first treating at home, in contrast to 11% in the case of fever. Amongst those who decided to visit a doctor, a suspected dengue infection would prompt them to search medical help earlier than if having only fever (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis modelling showed that the independent factors associated with the intention to firstly visit a doctor versus treating at home in the case of dengue were feeling at risk (OR = 3.29; p = 0.042) and being an adult (as opposed to caring for a child as a parent/guardian; OR = 3.33, p = 0.021), while having had a previous dengue infection (OR = 0.29; p = 0.031) and living in the neighbourhood Caña de Azúcar (OR = 0.28, p = 0.038) were negatively associated with seeking medical care as their first action. Conclusion Knowledge of HSB related to dengue is scarce in the Americas, our study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of HSB in this region. Improving early dengue disease recognition and awareness may enhance prompt attendance to medical care in affected populations and thereby reduce mortality and severity of dengue. Especially for those with a previous dengue infection, efforts have to be made to promote prompt health centre attendance.","2015","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:38:27","2022-01-04 10:08:35","e0004237","","12","9","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","Health Seeking Behaviour and Treatment Intentions of Dengue and Fever","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Medical risk factors; Behavioral and social aspects of health; Caregivers; Dengue fever; Fevers; Pediatrics; Physicians; Venezuela","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, to stratify dengue prevalence in space may be an efficacious strategy to target surveillance and control efforts in a cost-effective manner particularly in Venezuela where dengue is hyperendemic and public health resources are scarce. Here, we determine hot spots of dengue seroprevalence and the risk factors associated with these clusters using local spatial statistics and a regression modeling approach. Methodology/Principal Findings From August 2010 to January 2011, a community-based cross-sectional study of 2012 individuals in 840 households was performed in high incidence neighborhoods of a dengue hyperendemic city in Venezuela. Local spatial statistics conducted at household- and block-level identified clusters of recent dengue seroprevalence (39 hot spot households and 9 hot spot blocks) in all neighborhoods. However, no clusters were found for past dengue seroprevalence. Clustering of infection was detected at a very small scale (20-110m) suggesting a high disease focal aggregation. Factors associated with living in a hot spot household were occupation (being a domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.002), lower socio-economic status (living in a shack (P<0.001), sharing a household with <7 people (P = 0.004), promoting potential vector breeding sites (storing water in containers (P = 0.024), having litter outdoors (P = 0.002) and mosquito preventive measures (such as using repellent, P = 0.011). Similarly, low socio-economic status (living in crowded conditions, P<0.001), having an occupation of domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.012) and not using certain preventive measures against mosquitoes (P<0.05) were directly associated with living in a hot spot block. Conclusions/Significance Our findings contribute to a better comprehension of the spatial dynamics of dengue by assessing the relationship between disease clusters and their risk factors. These results can inform health authorities in the design of surveillance and control activities. Focalizing dengue control measures during epidemic and inter-epidemic periods to disease high risk zones at household and neighborhood-level may significantly reduce virus transmission in comparison to random interventions.","2017-01-23","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:38:29","2022-01-04 10:08:49","e0005317","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Epidemiology; Dengue virus; Infectious disease control; Medical risk factors; Dengue fever; Venezuela; Neighborhoods; Vector-borne diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, 57% of the examined houses had potential Aedes breeding sites indoors and/or outdoors, most of which positive for Aedes spp. larvae/pupae. Preventive practices were associated with a previous dengue infection (P = 0.030) and a better knowledge on dengue symptoms and transmission route (P = 0.020).

The long-term pattern of this disease has involved not only a general upward trend in cases but also a dramatic increase in the size and frequency of epidemic outbreaks. By assuming that climate variability has a relevant influence on these changes in time, we quantified the periodicity of dengue incidence in time-series of data from two northern regions of Venezuela. Disease cycles of 1 and 3–4 years (p < 0.05) were detected. We determined that dengue cycles corresponded with local climate and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation at both seasonal and inter-annual scales (every 2–3 years). Dengue incidence peaks were more prevalent during the warmer and dryer years of El Niño confirming that ENSO is a regional climatic driver of such long-term periodicity through local changes in temperature and rainfall.

Especially in low- and middle-income countries, eHealth could potentially offer cost-effective solutions to bridge financial, social, time, and distance challenges. Objective: The goal of the research is to understand what would make eHealth globally applicable and gain insight into different TB situations, opportunities, and challenges. Methods: We performed focus group interviews with TB experts and patients from 6 different countries on 4 different continents. The focus group interviews followed the theory of planned behavior framework to offer structured recommendations for a versatile eHealth solution. The focus group interviews were preceded by a general demographic and technology use questionnaire. Questionnaire results were analyzed using basic statistics in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Focus group interview data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti 8 (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH) by assigning codes to quotations and grouping codes into the 5 domains within the framework. Results: A total of 29 patients and 32 medical staff members were included in our study. All medical staff had used the internet, whereas 31% (9/61) of patients had never been online. The codes with the most quotations were information in relation to eHealth (144 quotations) and communication (67 quotations). The consensus among all participants from all countries is that there are important communication and information gaps that could be bridged by an eHealth app. Participants from different countries also highlighted different challenges, such as a majority of asylum-seeker patients or lack of infrastructure that could be addressed with an eHealth app. Conclusions: Within the 6 countries interviewed, there is high enthusiasm toward eHealth in TB. A potential app could first target information and communication gaps in TB, with additional modules aimed at setting-specific challenges.","2020-11-02","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:39:44","2022-01-04 10:11:24","e18156","","11","8","","","Patients and Medical Staff Attitudes Toward the Future Inclusion of eHealth in Tuberculosis Management","","","","","","","EN","Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

The efficient deployment of disease prevention measures and prediction of disease spread to new regions requires an in-depth understanding of spatial heterogeneity on malaria transmission dynamics. Herein, we characterized the spatial epidemiology of malaria in southern Venezuela from 2007 through 2017 and described the extent to which malaria distribution has changed country-wide over the recent years. We found that disease transmission was focal and more prevalent in the southeast region of southern Venezuela where two persistent hotspots of Plasmodium vivax (76%) and P. falciparum (18%) accounted for ~60% of the total number of cases. Such hotspots are linked to deforestation as a consequence of illegal gold mining activities. Incidence has increased nearly tenfold over the last decade, showing an explosive epidemic growth due to a significant lack of disease control programs.

Serum free thiols (R-SH, sulfhydryl groups) comprise a robust marker of systemic oxidative stress, since they are readily oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, serum free thiol concentrations were measured in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls and their associations with relevant clinical parameters were examined. Serum free thiol concentrations were measured colorimetrically (Ellman&rsquo;s method) in 29 non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects and 30 age-, sex-, and body-mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls and analyzed for associations with clinical and biochemical disease parameters. Additional free thiol measurements were performed on seven serum samples from COVID-19 subjects who required hospitalization to examine their correlation with disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 had significantly lower concentrations of serum free thiols compared to healthy controls (p = 0.014), indicating oxidative stress. Serum free thiols were positively associated with albumin (St. &beta; = 0.710, p &lt; 0.001) and inversely associated with CRP (St. &beta; = &minus;0.434, p = 0.027), and showed significant discriminative ability to differentiate subjects with COVID-19 from healthy controls (AUC = 0.69, p = 0.011), which was slightly higher than the discriminative performance of CRP concentrations regarding COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.042).

Following production patterns, network properties and added-value chains, exportable surpluses of countries can offset food and feed deficits in other countries. However, production and trade patterns are barely addressed in the scientific literature as two interactive components of global agriculture. Integrated analysis of the temporal dynamics and distribution patterns of production and trade among countries can help addressing future food security challenges in view of ongoing trends. Here, we analyse the interdependent patterns of global agricultural production and trade from 1986 to 2016. We classify total production and trade mass into six product categories—cereals, oilcrops, meat, fruits and vegetables, coffee and cocoa. We estimate reexports in global trade by assessing mass balances of production, imports and exports per country. We show that global trade and reexports increase exponentially faster than production and that production and trade are highly centralized among a small number of countries. For most agricultural categories, the centralization of flows has increased in time for production and net exports, and has decreased for net imports and reexports. Accordingly, a growing number of deficient countries are sustained by a decreasing number of top-producing countries. In parallel, reexport routes are increasingly dominated by long-industrialized countries besides the increase in time in the number of reexporting countries. We discuss the interdependencies between global agricultural production and trade patterns. We highlight the drivers and implications of the observed trends for food security challenges.","2022-02","2022-07-07 09:56:34","2022-07-07 09:56:34","2022-07-07 09:55:31","034022","","3","17","","Environ.

The impact of these additional resources on infectious diseases can manifest through different pathways, affecting host susceptibility, contact rate and host demography. To date however, empirical research has tended to examine these different pathways in isolation, for example by quantifying the effects of provisioning on host behaviour in the wild or changes in immune responses in controlled laboratory studies. Furthermore, while theory has investigated the interactions between these pathways, this work has focussed on a narrow subset of pathogen types, typically directly transmitted microparasites. Given the diverse ways that provisioning can affect host susceptibility, contact patterns or host demography, we may expect the epidemiological consequences of provisioning to vary among different parasite types, dependent on key aspects of parasite life history, such as the duration of infection and transmission mode. Focusing on an exemplar empirical system, the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, and its diverse parasite community, we developed a suite of epidemiological models to compare how resource provisioning alters responses for a range of these parasites that vary in their biology (microparasite and macroparasite), transmission mode (direct, environmental and vector transmitted) and duration of infection (acute, latent and chronic) within the same host population. We show there are common epidemiological responses to host resource provisioning across all parasite types examined. In particular, the epidemiological impact of provisioning could be driven in opposite directions, depending on which host pathways (contact rate, susceptibility or host demography) are most altered by the addition of resources to the environment. Broadly, these responses were qualitatively consistent across all parasite types, emphasising the importance of identifying general trade-offs between provisioning-altered parameters. Despite the qualitative consistency in responses to provisioning across parasite types, we predicted notable quantitative differences between parasites, with directly transmitted parasites (those conforming to SIR and SIS frameworks) predicted to show the strongest responses to provisioning among those examined, whereas the vector-borne parasites showed negligible responses to provisioning. As such, these analyses suggest that different parasites may show different scales of response to the same provisioning scenario, even within the same host population. This highlights the importance of knowing key aspects of host–parasite biology, to understand and predict epidemiological responses to provisioning for any specific host–parasite system.","2022","2022-07-08 12:00:55","2022-07-08 12:01:16","2022-07-08 12:00:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.13751","","","","","epidemiology; disease ecology; Apodemus sylvaticus; compartmental models; host–parasite interactions; provisioning; resource levels; supplemental feeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately 260 species have been recognized and grouped recently into a simplified system of 15 subgenera. Most of the species are nest-building and primitively eusocial. Species of Bombus have been more intensely studied than any other lineages of bees with the exception of the honey bees. However, most bumble bee fossils are poorly described and documented, making their placement relative to other Bombus uncertain. A large portion of the known and presumed bumble bee fossils were re-examined in an attempt to better understand their affinities with extant Bombini. The taxonomic affinities of fossil specimens were re-assessed based on morphological features and previous descriptions, and for 13 specimens based on geometric morphometrics of forewing shape. None of the specimens coming from Eocene and Oligocene deposits were assigned within the contemporary shape space of any subgenus of Bombus. It is shown that Calyptapis florissantensis Cockerell, 1906 (Eocene-Oligocene boundary, Florissant shale, Colorado, USA) and Oligobombus cuspidatus Antropov, 2014 (Late Eocene, Bembridge Marls) likely belong to stem-group Bombini.

In the Miocene, affinities of fossils with derived subgenera of Bombus s. l. increased, and some are included in the shape space of contemporary subgenera: Cullumanobombus (i.e., B. pristinus Unger, 1867, B. randeckensis Wappler &amp; Engel, 2012, and B. trophonius Prokop, Dehon, Michez &amp; Engel, 2017), Melanobombus (i.e., B. cerdanyensis Dehon, De Meulemeester &amp; Engel, 2014), and Mendacibombus (i.e., B. beskonakensis (Nel &amp; Petrulevičius, 2003), new combination), agreeing with previous estimates of diversification.","2019-11-21","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:25:41","71-118","","","891","","","","","","","","","","en","2022 Manuel Dehon, Michael S.

However, foraging on a new alternative plant, such as an invasive species, can modify diet quality and have a potentially detrimental effect on bee health. Herein, we investigated whether the spread of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera affects Bombus pascuorum population regarding parasite prevalence, genetic structure, and nest density in Belgium. While no difference in bumble bee genetic structure was detected between invaded and uninvaded sites, we show that I. glandulifera occurrence was significantly correlated with a decrease in the prevalence of Apicystis bombi but not the prevalence of three other parasite species (i.e., Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, Nosema ceranae, and Nosema sp.). Regarding our investigations, this effect was likely not due to variation in local bumble bee population fitness before I. glandulifera flowering, nor to the relative abundance of other pollinators such as Apis mellifera, but the unique chemical composition (i.e., polyphenol rich) of the pollen of I. glandulifera remained as an interesting hypothesis. Whereas B. pascuorum queens probably colonize all the potential nesting sites in an area, invaded by I. glandulifera or not, the abundance of polyphenol ampelopsin in pollen from I. glandulifera pollen might reduce local parasite prevalence. Our field study confirms that bumble bee parasite prevalence is potentially related to the particular chemical composition of collected pollen. Plant traits such as secondary metabolite occurrence could play a key role in the health and conservation of bumble bees.","2019","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:31:54","e02804","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.2804","","","","","conservation; bumble bee; insect pollinator; invasive plants; parasites; population genetic diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This issue is exemplified in bumble bees (Bombus), where species can exhibit high colour variation across their range, but otherwise exhibit little morphological variation to distinguish them from close relatives. We examine the species status of one of the most abundant North American bumble bees, Bombus bifarius Cresson, which historically comprised two major taxa, bifarius s.s. and nearcticus. These lineages are recognized primarily by red and black variation in their mid-abdominal coloration; however, a continuum from black (nearcticus) to red (bifarius s.s.) variation has led to their historic synonymization. Integrating mitochondrial and nuclear data and whole-genome sequencing, we reveal a high level of both mitochondrial and nuclear divergence delimiting two morphologically cryptic species – the red bifarius s.s. and the colour-variable (black to red) nearcticus. Population genomic analysis supports an absence of recent genomic admixture and a strong population structure between the two clades, even in sympatry. Species distribution models predict partially differentiated niches between the genetically inferred clades with annual precipitation being a leading differentiating variable. The bifarius s.s. lineage also occupies significantly higher elevations, with regions of sympatry being among the highest elevations in nearcticus. Our data also support a subspecies-level divergence between the broadly distributed nearcticus and the island population vancouverensis. In this paper, we formally recognize the two species, Bombus bifarius Cresson and Bombus vancouverensis Cresson, the latter including the subspecies B. vancouverensis vancouverensis comb.n. and B. vancouverensis nearcticus comb.n., with vancouverensis the name bearer due to year priority.","2020","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:58","635-652","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/syen.12419","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bees are, in this context, a popular example of a highly diversified group of pollinators whose collapse is a major concern given the invaluable ecosystem services they provide. Amongst them, bumblebees (Bombus) have increasingly drawn the attention of scientists due to their dramatic population declines globally. This regression has converted them into popular conservation entities, making them the second most studied group of bees worldwide. However, in addition to have become relevant models in the fields of ecology, evolution and biogeography, bumblebees have also been used as models for studying wild bee decline and conservation worldwide. Integrating evidence from the comparative ecology and resilience of bumblebees and wild bees, I discuss the relevance of using Bombus as radars for wild bee decline worldwide. Responses of bumblebees to environmental changes are generally not comparable with those of wild bees because of their relatively long activity period, their inherent sensitivity to high temperatures, their relatively generalist diet breadth and many aspects arising from their eusocial behavior. Moreover, important differences in the available historical data between bumblebees and other bees make comparisons of conservation status even more arduous. Overall, these results reinforce the need for conservation actions that consider a higher level of understanding of ecological diversity in wild bees, highlight the need for an updated and more extensive sampling of these organisms, and emphasize that more caution is required when extrapolating trends from model species.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:04","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst negative population trends within this functional group have understandably received much attention in recent decades, another facet of global changes has been overshadowed: species undergoing expansion. Here, we review the factors and traits that have allowed a fraction of the pollinating entomofauna to take advantage of global environmental change. Sufficient mobility, high resistance to acute heat stress, and inherent adaptation to warmer climates appear to be key traits that allow pollinators to persist and even expand in the face of climate change. An overall flexibility in dietary and nesting requirements is common in expanding species, although niche specialization can also drive expansion under specific contexts. The numerous consequences of wild and domesticated pollinator expansions, including competition for resources, pathogen spread, and hybridization with native wildlife, are also discussed. Overall, we show that the traits and factors involved in the success stories of expanding pollinators are mostly species specific and context dependent, rendering generalizations of ‘winning traits’ complicated. This work illustrates the increasing need to consider expansion and its numerous consequences as significant facets of global changes and encourages efforts to monitor the impacts of expanding insect pollinators, particularly exotic species, on natural ecosystems.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:25","2755-2770","","6","96","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12777","","","","","conservation; invasive species; global change; bees; bumblebees; butterflies; exotic species; expansion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effective development of conservation tools in order to counteract these changes relies on unambiguous taxonomic determination and delineation. In this study, we focus on an endemic bumblebee species recorded only from the highest altitudes of the Sierra Nevada (Spain), Bombus reinigiellus (Rasmont, 1983). The species has the smallest range of any European bumblebee, along with a restricted diet and an inability to disperse because of its isolated montane distribution, making it an appropriate conservation target. However, through an integrative taxonomic approach including genetics, morphometrics and semio-chemistry, we demonstrate the conspecificity of this taxon with one of the most common and widespread bumblebee species of Europe, Bombus hortorum (L. 1761). We assign a subspecies status to this endemic taxon (Bombus hortorum reinigiellus comb. nov.) shown to be different in colour and morphology but also in wing shape and relative wing size compared to the other conspecific subspecies. Following our taxonomic revision, we reassessed the IUCN conservation status of Bombus hortorum both at the continental and Spanish scale.

Some of the taxa found to be threatened are the often rare socially parasitic bumble bees. Among these, the socially parasitic bumble bee, Bombus flavidus Eversmann, has uncertain species status. Although multiple separate species allied with B. flavidus have been suggested, until recently, recognition of two species, a Nearctic Bombus fernaldae (Franklin) and Palearctic B. flavidus, was favored. Limited genetic data, however, suggested that even these could be a single widespread species. We addressed the species status of this lineage using an integrative taxonomic approach, combining cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and nuclear sequencing, wing morphometrics, and secretions used for mate attraction, and explored patterns of color polymorphism that have previously confounded taxonomy in this lineage. Our results support the conspecificity of fernaldae and flavidus; however, we revealed a distinct population within this broader species confined to eastern North America. This makes the distribution of the social parasite B. flavidus the broadest of any bumble bee, broader than the known distribution of any nonparasitic bumble bee species. Color polymorphisms are retained across the range of the species, but may be influenced by local mimicry complexes. Following these results, B. flavidusEversmann, 1852 is synonymized with Bombus fernaldae (Franklin, 1911) syn. nov. and a subspecific status, Bombus flavidus appalachiensisssp. nov., is assigned to the lineage ranging from the Appalachians to the eastern boreal regions of the United States and far southeastern Canada.","2021-03-01","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:29:28","5","","2","5","","Insect Systematics and Diversity","Diversification Pattern of the Widespread Holarctic Cuckoo Bumble Bee, Bombus flavidus (Hymenoptera","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amongst these threats, many synergistic drivers, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, increasing use of agrochemicals, decreasing resource diversity, as well as climate change, are known to affect wild and managed bees. Therefore, reliable indicators for pollinator sensitivity to such threats are needed. Biological traits, such as phenotype (e.g. shape, size and asymmetry) and storage reserves (e.g. fat body size), are important pollinator traits linked to reproductive success, immunity, resilience and foraging efficiency and, therefore, could serve as valuable markers of bee health and pollination service potential.This data paper contains an extensive dataset of wing morphology and fat body content for the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) sampled at 128 sites across eight European countries in landscape gradients dominated by two major bee-pollinated crops (apple and oilseed rape), before and after focal crop bloom and potential pesticide exposure. The dataset also includes environmental metrics of each sampling site, namely landscape structure and pesticide use. The data offer the opportunity to test whether variation in the phenotype and fat bodies of bees is structured by environmental factors and drivers of global change.

Though predominantly generalists, some bumble bee species seem to have restricted dietary choices. It is unclear whether restricted diets in bumble bees are inherent or a function of local conditions due to a lack of data for many species across different regions. The objective of this study was to determine whether bumble bee species displayed specific patterns of pollen collection, and whether patterns were influenced by phylogenetic relatedness or tongue length, a trait known to be associated with structuring floral visitation. Bumble bee pollen collection patterns were quantified from 4,132 pollen loads taken from 58 bumble bee species, representing 24% of the pollen-collecting diversity of this genus. Phylogenetic trait mapping showed a conserved pattern of dietary dissimilarity across species, but not for dietary breadth. Dietary dissimilarity was driven by collection of Fabaceae, with the most similar species collecting around 50%–60% of their diet from this botanical family. The proportion of the diet collected from Fabaceae also showed a conserved phylogenetic signal. Greater collection of Fabaceae was associated with longer tongue lengths, with shorter tongued species focusing on alternative botanical families. However, this result was largely driven by phylogenetic relatedness, not tongue length per se. These results demonstrate that, though generalists, bumble bees are still subject to dietary restrictions that constrain their foraging choices. These dietary constraints have implications for their persistence should their core resources decline in abundance.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:32:41","2421-2430","","10","90","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.13553","","","","","Fabaceae; Bombus; dietary specialisation; museum specimens; pollen analysis; tongue length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the potential for agroecological intensification of pollinator-dependent crops by harnessing pollinator diversity is limited by our capacity to characterise the community of pollinator species for each crop, and to determine how it is influenced by the different survey methods used, as well as by climatic variables at larger geographic scales. Here, we surveyed wild bees using a standardised protocol at an unprecedented scale including 62 commercial apple orchards in Western and Central Europe (i) to validate recent findings on pollinator community divergence as measured by common survey methods (netting and pan trapping) using conventional and alternative biodiversity metrics (phylogenetic and functional diversity), and (ii) to investigate the impact of climatic variation on the patterns observed. Our results confirm the significant divergence in pollinator communities measured using the two common methods at the larger, sub-continental scale, and we provide evidence for a significant influence of climate on the magnitude of pollinator community divergence (beta diversity and its turnover component) between survey methods, particularly when comparing colder to warmer sites and regions. We also found that warmer sites are more dissimilar than colder sites in terms of species composition, functional traits, or phylogenetic affinities. This result probably stems from the comparatively larger species pool in Southern Europe and because apple flowers are accessible to a wide spectrum of pollinator species; hence, two distant survey localities in Southern Europe are more likely to differ significantly in their pollinator community. Collectively, our results demonstrate the spatially-varying patterns of pollinator communities associated with common survey methods along a climate gradient and at the sub-continental scale in Europe.","2022-05-01","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:29:03","107871","","","329","","Agric.

It is still not clear if specific sRNAs are selected for secretion, or if sRNA secretion is mostly passive. We sequenced the intracellular sRNA content (19–60 nt) of breast epithelial cell lines (MCF-7 and MCF-10A) and compared it with extracellular fractions enriched in microvesicles, exosomes and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Our results are consistent with a non-selective secretion model for most microRNAs, although a few showed secretion patterns consistent with preferential secretion. On the contrary, 5′ tRNA halves and 5′ RNA Y4-derived fragments of 31–33 were greatly and significantly enriched in the extracellular space (even in non-mammary cell lines), where tRNA halves were detected as part of ∼45 kDa ribonucleoprotein complexes.

However, deproteinization of non-vesicular tRNA halves does not affect their retention in size-exclusion chromatography. Thus, we considered alternative explanations for their extracellular stability. In-silico analysis of the sequence of these tRNA-derived fragments showed that tRNAGly 5′ halves can form homodimers or heterodimers with tRNAGlu 5′ halves. This capacity is virtually unique to glycine tRNAs. By analyzing synthetic oligonucleotides by size exclusion chromatography, we provide evidence that dimerization is possible in vitro. tRNA halves with single point substitutions preventing dimerization are degraded faster both in controlled nuclease digestion assays and after transfection in cells, showing that dimerization can stabilize tRNA halves against the action of cellular nucleases. Finally, we give evidence supporting dimerization of endogenous tRNAGlyGCC 5′ halves inside cells.

For these reasons, a Bayesian coalescent Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of complete genome sequences of ZIKV strains recently isolated in the American continent was performed. The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of ZIKV strains in different genetic lineages and co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages in several countries in the region. The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was established to be around February 20, 2014 for ZIKV strains circulating in the American region. A mean rate of evolution of 1.55 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year was obtained for ZIKV strains included in this study.

They offer advantages as delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids such as small RNAs. Loading of desired nucleic acids into EVs can be achieved by electroporation or transfection once purified. An attractive alternative is to transfect cells with the desired small RNAs and harness the cellular machinery for RNA sorting into the EVs. This possibility has been less explored because cells are believed to secrete only specific RNAs. However, we hypothesized that, even in the presence of selective secretion, concentration-driven RNA sorting to EVs would still be feasible. To show this, we transfected cells with glycine 5ʹ tRNA halves, which we have previously shown to better resist RNases. We then measured their levels in EVs and in recipient cells and found that, in contrast to unstable RNAs of random sequence, these tRNA halves were present in vesicles and in recipient cells in amounts proportional to the concentration of RNA used for transfection. Similar efficiencies were obtained with other stable oligonucleotides of random sequence. Our results demonstrate that RNA stability is a key factor needed to maintain high intracellular concentrations, a prerequisite for efficient non-selective RNA sorting to EVs and delivery to cells. Given that glycine 5ʹ tRNA halves belong to the group of stress-induced tRNA fragments frequently detected in extracellular space and biofluids, we propose that upregulation of extracellular tRNA fragments is consequential to cellular stress and might be involved in intercellular signalling.","2020-08-02","2022-09-14 15:33:37","2022-09-14 15:33:37","2022-09-14 15:29:16","1168-1182","","8","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.1708548 PMID: 31885318","","","","","exosomes; intercellular communication; secretion; tiRNAs; vesicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This species successfully colonised the Indian subcontinent more than four decades ago, and more recently South and North America. Within the EU, the pest occurs in Cyprus, Malta, Portugal (Madeira) and Spain (Canary Islands and Andalusia). Z. indianus is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/ 2072. The larvae of this ﬂy feed on more than 80 plant species both cultivated and non-cultivated. Females produce around 60–70 eggs. Egg laying mostly occurs in decaying fruit or fruit with injuries or mechanical damage. However, Z. indianus can oviposit on undamaged healthy fruit such as ﬁgs, strawberries and guavas which provide a potential pathway for entry into the EU. Lower temperature thresholds are around 9–10°C. Optimum development occurs at 28°C. The number of generations per year varies from 12 to 16. Climatic conditions in many EU member states and host plant availability in those areas are conducive for establishment.

This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. T. parvicornis is a soft-scale insect native to North America and has been introduced to the Caribbean region and the EU. It has been present in Italy since 2014 (Abruzzo, Campania, Lazio, and Apulia regions) and in France since 2021 (Provence–Alpes–Co^te d’Azur region) and is under ofﬁcial control. It develops on Pinus spp. (Pinaceae), feeding on the needles and twigs, especially on new growth. It is sexually reproductive, has one or more generations each year (three in southern Italy), and adult females overwinter on the Pinus needles. It has a high fecundity, up to 1,014 eggs per female in Italy, with an average of 199 eggs for the summer generation and 730 for the overwintering generation. The main natural dispersal stage is the ﬁrst instar, which crawls over the plant or may be dispersed further by wind and animals. The species can be transported over longer distances with plants for planting. Large populations cause yellowing, needle loss, reduction in growth and recruitment, ﬂagging, dieback and tree mortality. It has had a signiﬁcant impact to P. pinea (stone pine) in Italy and caused a catastrophic decline of P. caribbea var. bahamensis (Caribbean pine) in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Adult and immature T. parvicornis could enter the EU with Pinus plants for planting; however, the import of Pinus from third countries where the scale is found is prohibited. Host availability and climate suitability indicate that most of the EU would be suitable for establishment.

T. perseae is a tropical and subtropical species that originated in the Neotropical region and has now spread and established in the USA (California and Florida), Israel and Lebanon. T. perseae is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is oligophagous on Lauraceae and most frequently reported on avocado (Persea americana), on which it is considered a minor or secondary pest. No evidence was found indicating damage to other plants. T. perseae larvae develop on the foliage and don’t attack the fruit. The number of generations per year varies between one and ten. High populations may promote the growth of black sooty moulds on the foliage and fruit, and adults feeding on the buds can lead to deformed immature leaves and premature leaf drop. However, T. perseae populations are usually effectively controlled by hymenopteran parasitoids, at least one of which (Cales noacki) is widespread in the EU. The producers of organic avocados in the EU could encourage the use of C. noacki, although occasional outbreaks of T. perseae could temporarily impact the fruit quality. Adults disperse naturally by flying and all stages can be moved over long distances by the trade of infested plant material. Plants for planting provide potential pathways for entry and spread in the EU. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern EU countries are conducive for establishment. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the risk. T. perseae satisfies all of the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

This species is present in Japan (except Hokkaidō), the Republic of Korea and 13 Chinese provinces. S. nitobei attacks several Pinus species and has been reported less frequently on Abies firma and Larix spp., including L. leptolepis. The females oviposit into the sapwood. Eggs are deposited together with a phytotoxic mucus and a symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum areolatum or A. chailletii. The combined action of the venom and the fungus results in the death of the host trees. The fungus degrades the lignocellulosic components of the wood, and the larvae feed on the liquid fraction of the digested residues left by the fungus. All immature stages live in the hosts sapwood. The lifecycle of the pest lasts 1 year. S. nitobei can travel with conifer wood, wood packaging material or plants for planting, but these pathways from third countries are closed by prohibition. However, a derogation exists for artificially dwarfed Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) from Japan, which therefore provides a potential pathway.

It has recently been reported from Spain (Catalonia; Region of Valencia), Greece (Athens; Crete) and France (Hérault; Gironde). X. chinensis attacks and kills Morus spp. in Europe and is also a pest of Malus domestica, Pyrus sp. and Vitis vinifera in Asia.

Each female produces approximately 80 eggs which are laid on the bark. The larvae live in the phloem and tunnel into the xylem where they pupate. Infested trees show injuries including longitudinal slits in the bark, caused by larval activity next to the surface and round exit holes from which frass emerges. The females respond to a male sex pheromone, which has not been developed into a detection method. The adults spread by flight as suggested by the local expansion of damage in Europe. However, wood packaging material and wooden objects can also be a pathway as suggested by interceptions in Germany and the USA.

This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. T. japonensis Uchida & Inouye is a well-defined species, native to a large part of Japan, which was introduced to the Republic of Korea and eastern China: Fujian and Shandong. It attacks Pinus densiflora, P. thunbergii and P. luchuensis in Japan; P. densiflora and P. thunbergii in Korea; and P. massoniana in China, and has been observed to attack other two-needle pine species, including species present in the EU. The pest is univoltine and the adults emerge between May and August. The adults live only for 1 day. Each female oviposits in batches on developing needles. The neonate larvae crawl to the base of the needle fascicle and create a gall in which they feed gregariously by sap sucking. The third-instar larvae leave the galls in November, overwinter in a cocoon in the soil and pupate at the end of the winter. Degree day models have been developed to predict adult emergence. Survival of overwintering stages is poor below 15°C and above 30°C. The pest can be detected by its symptoms (stunted or dead needles, galls at the base of infected needle fascicles), and identified using morphological characters or the mitochondrial COI gene. T. japonensis is one of the major forest pests in the Republic of Korea, where 1.7 million trees were cut to control it in 2014–2015. It flies uneasily (a few hundred metres) but can be transported in galls on Pinus plants for planting, including artificially dwarfed plants, or with cut branches.

This oligophagous species, which feeds on Citrus spp. fruits, is known to occur in China (provinces of Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Sichuan). First-generation adults emerge in April and oviposit on the peduncle and calyx of citrus fruits. Larvae feed on the albedo (the white layer between skin and pulp) of the fruit, which they tunnel. Infested fruit most often drop prematurely. Larvae pupate either within the fallen fruit or in the soil. This species has three main peaks of activity (May, June–July, August–September) and four generations per year in its native range. Mature larvae from the last generation are the overwintering stage. Potential entry pathways for R. citrifrugis, such as Citrus spp. plants for planting with foliage and soil/growing media, and soil/growing media can be considered as closed. The citrus fruit pathway remains open from countries where R. citrifrugis is known to occur. Indeed, this species was intercepted in fresh pomelos 11 times from December 2020 to January 2021 in the EU. Should R. citrifrugis enter the EU, the ample availability of hosts (Citrus spp.) and the climatic conditions in citrus-growing areas of southern EU Member States would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Economic impact in citrus production is anticipated if establishment occurs. R. citrifrugis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. There is uncertainty about the nomenclature of R. citrifrugis and its exact host range. However, because the name Resseliella citrifrugis is used in multiple sources reporting it as a pest of citrus in China, where symptoms, biology and impact are described, these uncertainties do not affect the conclusions of this categorisation.","2021","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:22:28","e06802","","8","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; Cecidomyiidae; citrus fruit midge; Diptera","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is highly polyphagous, feeding on 230 plant species belonging to more than 70 botanical families with preference for avocado (Persea americana), citrus (Citrus spp.), coffee (Coffea sp.), guava (Psidium guajava), litchi (Litchi chinensis), mango (Mangifera indica), mulberry (Morus sp.) and pomegranate (Punica granatum). It has also been recorded feeding on some solanaceous plants: tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and pepper (Capsicum annuum), as well as on ornamental plants. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern EU countries would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Economic impact in cultivated hosts including citrus, mangoes, mulberries, as well as vegetable and ornamental crops is anticipated if establishment occurs. Indeed, P. psidii has already been reported causing damage to Melia azedarach, a widely used ornamental tree that lines streets in Valencia. There is contradictory information regarding impact in mangoes in Spain. This could be due to the relatively recent establishment of the pest. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread. P. psidii meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 14:48:14","e07526","","8","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","Hemiptera; pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; Coccidae; green shield scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P. apicalis is a polyphagous pest native to New Zealand. The majority of its life cycle is spent inside tree wood, but it does not directly feed on plant tissue, instead larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus (Sporothrix nothofagi which is pathogenic to Nothofagus spp.) vectored by adults and introduced when they bore tunnels into the host. P. apicalis feeds within a wide range of live, often stressed trees, in dead or dying hardwood and softwood trees, and fallen or felled trees. Successful reproduction can occur inside a number of living tree species including Castanea sativa, Pinus spp. and Ulmus spp. P. apicalis is not known to have established outside of New Zealand although findings have been reported in Australia. Whilst there are no records of interceptions of this species in the EU, platypodines are intercepted with solid wood packing material (SWPM) and Platypus species, but not P. apicalis, have been intercepted with wooden logs in Japan. Host plants for planting also provide a potential pathway. Hosts are grown widely across the EU in areas with climates comparable to those in New Zealand where the pest occurs suggesting that conditions in the EU are suitable for its establishment. If introduced into the EU, adults could disperse naturally by flight, perhaps tens or hundreds of metres. The movement of infested wood and host plants for planting within the EU could facilitate spread. Economic impacts in forestry and timber industries would result from the galleries created by P. apicalis and from wood staining caused by the symbiotic fungus.

It has recently been reported from Cyprus, Greece and Italy. This mealybug is a polyphagous pest, feeding on about 300 plant species. It usually feeds on aerial plant parts, especially new growth, but also occurs on roots, and is often associated with ants. It is an economically important pest of ornamentals, such as hibiscus and lantana, glasshouse vegetable crops, mainly bell pepper, tomato and eggplant, and field crops, such as cotton. Large populations cause die-back and reduction in yield. Adult and immature P. solenopsis could enter the EU with imported fresh fruit, vegetables and cut flowers, although the main pathway of introduction is likely to be plants for planting.

O. perseae is a tropical species that originated in Mesoamerica and has now spread and established in California, Florida, Hawaii, Morocco, southern Europe and Israel. Within the EU, it is established in Italy, Portugal and Spain. O. perseae is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is polyphagous, feeding on plants in 20 genera in 17 families. It is most frequently reported on avocado (Persea americana), where it is considered a key pest. No evidence was found indicating damage to other crops. O. perseae live on leaves and do not attack the fruit. Populations usually grow exponentially at the beginning of summer and decline at the end of this season. High population densities can cause severe defoliation, resulting in downgrading of fruit through sunburn. However, this type of damage is common only if trees additionally suffer from water stress. The lack of additional avocado pests in the EU, which facilitates the production of organic avocados, is jeopardised by the occurrence of this mite, as it may require pesticide applications. This is why O. perseae is considered an important pest of avocados in Spain, where more than 80% of EU avocado production occurs. Natural dispersal is restricted to neighbouring trees. However, human-assisted movement can result in long-distance spread. Plants for planting provide potential pathways for further entry and spread, including O. perseae-free EU MS where avocados are grown (i.e. Cyprus, France, Greece). Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern EU countries are conducive for establishment. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of further entry and spread.

The polyphagous mite feeds on more than 50 host plants including tropical fruits such as mangoes and avocados and temperate fruits such as pears, peaches, pomegranates and grapes. It occurs in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America. O. mangiferus is multivoltine and can develop throughout the year as long as temperatures are above 12°C. The species produces dense webs on the above-ground parts of their host plants, where all stages of development (egg, larva, nymph and adult) can be found. This species is considered a pest of mango, grapevine, lychee and pomegranate, mostly in areas with hotter climates than those occurring in the EU. Potential entry pathways for O. mangiferus include plants for planting with foliage, fruit and cut flowers.

These hosts occur in the EU as ornamental/amenity trees. Other scales in the Matsucoccus genus feed on a variety of Pinus species and the host range of M. massonianae could be wider than is currently recorded. There is one generation per year. All stages occur on the branches and stems of hosts with developing nymphs and adult females feeding under the bark on the phloem vessels of the host. Symptoms include the yellowing/browning of host needles, early needle drop, desiccation of shoots and bark necrosis. The most serious infestations occur in hosts aged 8–25 years old and there can be some host mortality. In principle, host plants for planting and plant products such as cut branches and wood with bark could provide entry pathways into the EU.

This oligophagous species, which feeds on fruit and leaves of Solanum aethiopicum (Ethiopian eggplant) and S. melongena (eggplant), is known to occur in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Liberia, Senegal, Uganda). Adults oviposit on leaves and newly hatched caterpillars can bore into shoots, causing wilting and dieback, before moving into the fruit, which they tunnel. Damage may be visible only if the fruit is cut open. A single aubergine can be infested by up to 20 larvae. Mature larvae abandon the fruit to pupate in a cocoon in the soil. Adult moths fly for short distances only in darkness. Potential entry pathways for L. pseudorbonalis, such as Solanum spp. plants for planting and soil/growing media are regulated and can be considered as closed.

Following taxonomic revision, literature reporting L. orbonalis from sub-Saharan Africa should be regarded as referring to members of a complex of other species of Leucinodes native to Africa and not as referring to L. orbonalis. L. orbonalis is not present in the EU and is not a regulated EU pest. L. orbonalis is a major pest of Solanum melongena (eggplant) in Asia where larvae feed within leaves, stems, shoots and fruits. Larvae can also feed on a range of other plants, mostly within Solanaceae although L. orbonalis is generally not reported as a pest of crops other than S. melongena. However, in recent years L. orbonalis has emerged as a pest of Solanum tuberosum in south-west India. In tropical areas there can be 10 generations per year if conditions are suitable.

Most NESC species (bark beetles) live in the inner bark of their hosts (phloem and cambium), while the remaining species mostly colonise the sapwood (ambrosia beetles). Bark- and ambrosia beetles are often associated with symbiotic fungi, which behave as pathogens towards the host trees, or are used as food by ambrosia beetle larvae. The larvae live in individual tunnels or in communal chambers. Pupation occurs in the wood or in the bark. Some species are semi- or multivoltine, others are monovoltine. Some species attack and kill living, apparently healthy trees. Other species specialise in weakened, dying or dead trees. The pathways for entry are cut branches, cones, round wood with or without bark, sawn wood with or without bark, wood packaging material, bark, manufactured wood items and wood chips and plants for planting (including seeds) of conifers. Availability of host plants and suitable climate would allow the establishment in the EU of NESC. Measures are in place to prevent their introduction through the pathways described above. NESC satisfy all the criteria to be considered as Union quarantine pests. As NESC are not present in the EU and plants for planting are not their major pathway for spread, they do not meet the criteria to be considered as regulated non-quarantine pests.","2020","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:26:58","e05934","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","European Union; pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; ambrosia beetles; Bark beetles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

N. andropogonis is a tropical and subtropical species that originates in south central Asia and has recently established in Iran and Iraq. N. andropogonis is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is oligophagous on Poaceae and most frequently reported on sugarcane (Saccharum ofﬁcinarum), on which it has become an important emerging pest in western Iran. The larvae feed on the foliage and stalks and can cause a reduction of photosynthesis rate and growth. In heavy infestations, the sugar purity and content are greatly decreased. Honeydew egested by feeding N. andropogonis larvae can promote the growth of black sooty mould over the host. No evidence was found indicating economic damage to other grasses. The ornamental grass hosts Andropogon sp. and Imperata cylindrica are ornamental grasses in the subfamily Panicoideae and are exempt from a general prohibition on Poaceae entering the EU and together with fresh sugarcane, provide potential pathways for entry. An estimated threshold for development from egg to adult of 7.2°C with approximately 500 degree days required for a generation suggests that climatic conditions, together with the availability of grass hosts in the southern EU, would support establishment. Adults disperse naturally by ﬂying and all stages can be moved over long distances by the trade of infested plant material. The pest has the potential to impact sugarcane production in Portugal and Spain. N. andropogonis satisﬁes all of the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. However, this conclusion has high uncertainties regarding the likelihood of entry and the magnitude of potential impact within the EU as the insect is only recorded as an economically important pest in Iran, and its host range is poorly known and understood.","2022-11","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-13 13:44:58","","","11","20","","EFS2","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M. disstria is a North American polyphagous leaf-eating pest primarily feeding on deciduous trees belonging to the genera Acer, Malus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus and Tilia. It is a univoltine species. Eggs are laid on twigs and branches. Larvae emerge in the spring to feed on buds and fresh leaves. Host plants can be completely defoliated although they often refoliate and recover within a few weeks. Nevertheless, three consecutive years of heavy defoliation or repeated periods of defoliation combined with drought can cause extensive tree mortality. As such, M. disstria is regarded as one of the most serious hardwood forestry insect pests in North America. Population upsurges leading to outbreaks are cyclical, generally nine to 13 years apart and can last 2–3 years. Outbreaks have been reported in eastern North America since the late 18th century. Outbreaks in western Canada have spanned up to 200,000 km2. Plants for planting, cut branches and isolated bark provide pathways for entry. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that large parts of the EU would be suitable for establishment. The pest could spread naturally by flight within the EU. Eggs on plants for planting could also facilitate spread. The introduction of M. disstria into the EU could lead to serious outbreaks causing significant damage to forest, orchard and amenity trees and shrubs. Phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit the entry and spread of this species. M. disstria satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:07:03","e07208","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; forest tent caterpillar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the EU, the pest has been reported from Cyprus and Greece (Rhodes). M. hirsutus is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is highly polyphagous, feeding on plants assigned to 229 genera in 78 plant families, and shows some preference for hosts in the families Malvaceae, Fabaceae and Moraceae. Economically important crops in the EU such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), citrus (Citrus spp.), ornamentals (Hibiscus spp.), grapes (Vitis vinifera), soybean (Glycinae max), avocado (Persea americana) and mulberry trees (Morus alba) may be significantly affected by M. hirsutus. The lower and upper developmental temperature threshold of M. hirsutus on Hibiscus rosa-sinensis are 14.5 and 35.0°C, respectively, with optimal female development estimated to be at 29.0°C. There are about 10 generations a year in the subtropics but as many as 15 may occur under optimal conditions. Plants for planting, fruits, vegetables and cut flowers provide potential pathways for entry into the EU. Climatic conditions in EU member states around the Mediterranean Sea and host plant availability in those areas are conducive for establishment. The introduction of M. hirsutus is expected to have an economic impact in the EU through damage to various ornamental plants, as already observed in Cyprus and Greece, and reduction in yield and quality of many significant crops. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread.

D. spectabilis is native to China, Japan and Korea. Its larvae primarily feed on the needles of Pinus densiﬂora and P. thunbergii and can also feed on P. strobus, P. rigida, P. taeda and P. tabuliformis. The pest can have one or two generations per year; winter is mostly spent as ﬁfth instar larvae in the soil. Adults emerge in July and August and females lay egg masses of 200–300 eggs on coniferous host needles. Natural enemies are described as signiﬁcant factors of population density changes in Japan and the Republic of Korea. The pest can be detected visually, and there are morphological keys as well as molecular markers allowing identiﬁcation. D. spectabilis could enter the EU, either as eggs, larvae or pupae in the foliage of plants for planting or cut branches, as larvae on wood with bark or as overwintering larvae in the litter of potted plants. However, Annex VI of Regulation 2019/2072 prohibits the introduction of D. spectabilis hosts from countries and areas where the pest occurs. D. spectabilis occurs in climatic zones that are found in the EU, and the fact that it attacks the North American P. strobus, P. taeda and P. rigida in its Asian native area suggests a potential to shift to local conifer species in the EU territory.

Other economically important hosts suffering impacts include beans (Fabaceae), wheat and maize (Poaceae). Young plants are particularly vulnerable to adults and nymphs feeding on tender leaves and growing points, which can cause yield losses. B. hilaris occurs in Africa and Asia and has spread to North America (USA and Mexico) and South America (Chile) where there are multiple generations per year. It is not widely distributed in the EU but has been established in Malta and on the Italian island of Pantelleria, south west of Sicily, since the 1970s where it is an economically important pest of capers. The reasons why it has not spread further within southern Europe are unknown. B. hilaris is not a regulated pest in the EU. It could further enter and spread within the EU via the import and movement of host plants or as a hitchhiking species forming aggregations in conveyances and amongst non-plant traded goods. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that, in addition to Malta and Pantelleria, southern areas of the EU around the Mediterranean would also be suitable for B. hilaris establishment.

This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. Adults of A. kakogawana overwinter in broad-leaved and mixed forests and move to vineyards in the spring where there may be up to four generations, before adults move back to forests during late summer–early autumn to overwinter, possibly under diapause. A. kakogawana has a restricted host range (Vitis spp. and Parthenocissus quinquefolia). It is native to Eastern Asia, from where it moved westwards reaching southern Russia in 1999, and subsequently Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia in 2020. A. kakogawana develops on the abaxial side of the leaves causing chlorotic spots that reduce grape quality. Plants for planting of Vitis L. are banned from entering the EU except from Switzerland, where A. kakogawana is not known to occur. Therefore, this can be considered as a closed entry pathway. However, other plants for planting including the host P. quinquefolia and many broad-leaved trees where overwintering takes place, as well as isolated bark and wood with bark provide potential pathways which are partly regulated but remain open. There are no EU records of interception. Additional introductions and further spread of A. kakogawana into/within the EU, coupled with the ample availability of grapevines and the climatic conditions would most probably allow successful establishment in most EU member states. Should this happen, economic impact in table and wine grapes is anticipated. A. kakogawana satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest (UQP).","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:11:09","e07023","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","Cicadellidae; pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; Japanese grape leafhopper; Vitis spp.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using whole genome sequencing, the aim of our study was to clarify badger contribution to bTB transmission in this area. We used a Bayesian evolutionary model, to infer phylogenetic trees and migration rates between two pathogen populations defined by their host-species. In order to account for sampling bias, sub-population structure was inferred using the marginal approximation of the structured coalescent (Mascot) implemented in BEAST2. We included 167 SB0821 strains (21 isolated from badgers and 146 from cattle) and identified 171 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We selected a HKY model and a strict molecular clock. We estimated a badger-to-cattle transition rate (median: 2.2 transitions/lineage/year) 52 times superior to the cattle-to-badger rate (median: 0.042 transitions/lineage/year). Using the maximum clade credibility tree, we identified that over 75% of the lineages from 1989 to 2000 were present in badgers. In addition, we calculated a median of 64 transition events from badger-to-cattle (IQR: 10–91) and a median of zero transition event from cattle-to-badger (IQR: 0–3). Our model enabled us to infer inter-species transitions but not intra-population transmission as in previous epidemiological studies, where relevant units were farms and badger social groups. Thus, while we could not confirm badgers as possible intermediaries in farm-to-farm transmission, badger-to-cattle transition rate was high and we confirmed long-term presence of M. bovis in the badger population in the South-West of France.","2022-04-02","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:12:02","28","","1","53","","Vet.

Numerous reconstruction methods exist, each with their own assumptions, types of data, and inference strategy. Thus, selecting a method can be difficult. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature for methods combing epidemiological and genomic data in transmission tree reconstruction. We identified 22 methods from the 41 selected articles. We defined three families according to how genomic data was handled: a non-phylogenetic family, a sequential phylogenetic family, and a simultaneous phylogenetic family. We discussed methods according to the data needed as well as the underlying sequence mutation, within-host evolution, transmission, and case observation. In the non-phylogenetic family consisting of eight methods, pairwise genetic distances were estimated. In the phylogenetic families, transmission trees were inferred from phylogenetic trees either simultaneously (nine methods) or sequentially (five methods). While a majority of methods (17/22) modeled the transmission process, few (8/22) took into account imperfect case detection. Within-host evolution was generally (7/8) modeled as a coalescent process.

On average, 3.9 pathogens were positive per sample and 85.3% of samples tested positive for at least one. Pathogen detection and concentration varied significantly by pathogen, month, and age group in generalised linear (mixed) models and generalised estimating equations. High CO2 and low natural ventilation were independent risk factors for detection.

Using different wastewater collection points in Leuven, we wanted to investigate the use of wastewater surveillance as an early warning system for an uprise of infections and as a tool to follow the circulation of specific variants of concern (VOCs) in particular geographic areas. Wastewater samples were collected from local neighborhood sewers and from a large regional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the area of Leuven, Belgium. After virus concentration, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and normalized with the human fecal indicator pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). A combination of multiplex RT-qPCR assays was used to detect signature mutations of circulating VOCs. Fecal virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 variants was measured in feces samples of hospitalized patients. In two residential sampling sites, a rise in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentration preceded peaks in positive cases. In the WWTP, viral load peaks were seen concomitant with the consecutive waves of positive cases caused by the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and subsequent VOCs. During the Omicron BA.1 wave, the wastewater viral load increased to a lesser degree, even after normalization of SARS-CoV-2 concentration using PMMoV. This might be attributable to a lower level of fecal excretion of this variant. Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA1/BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 could be detected based on the presence of specific key mutations. The shift in variants was noticeable in the wastewater, with key mutations of two different variants being present simultaneously during the transition period. Wastewater-based surveillance is a sensitive tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 circulation levels and VOCs in larger regions. In times of reduced test capacity, this can prove to be highly valuable. Differences in excretion levels of various SARS-CoV-2 variants should however be taken into account when using wastewater surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 circulation levels in the population.","2023","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:01:09","e28587","","2","95","","J.

Methods This prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from February 2020 to June 2022 in 5 countries, enrolling SARS-CoV-2 out- and in-patients followed at 3-, 6-, and 12-month from diagnosis, with assessment of clinical and biochemical features, antibody (Ab) response, Variant of Concern (VoC), and physical and mental quality of life (QoL). Outcome of interest was identification of risk and protective factors of PCS by clinical phenotype, setting, severity of disease, treatment, and vaccination status. We used SF-36 questionnaire to assess evolution in QoL index during follow-up and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (principal component analysis, PCA) to explore symptom clusters. Severity of PCS was defined by clinical phenotype and QoL. We also used generalized linear models to analyse the impact of PCS on QoL and associated risk and preventive factors. CT registration number: NCT05097677. Findings Among 1796 patients enrolled, 1030 (57%) suffered from at least one symptom at 12-month. PCA identified 4 clinical phenotypes: chronic fatigue-like syndrome (CFs: fatigue, headache and memory loss, 757 patients, 42%), respiratory syndrome (REs: cough and dyspnoea, 502, 23%); chronic pain syndrome (CPs: arthralgia and myalgia, 399, 22%); and neurosensorial syndrome (NSs: alteration in taste and smell, 197, 11%). Determinants of clinical phenotypes were different (all comparisons p < 0.05): being female increased risk of CPs, NSs, and CFs; chronic pulmonary diseases of REs; neurological symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of REs, NSs, and CFs; oxygen therapy of CFs and REs; and gastrointestinal symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of CFs. Early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with monoclonal Ab (all clinical phenotypes), corticosteroids therapy for mild/severe cases (NSs), and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (CPs) were less likely to be associated to PCS (all comparisons p < 0.05). Highest reduction in QoL was detected in REs and CPs (43.57 and 43.86 vs 57.32 in PCS-negative controls, p < 0.001). Female sex (p < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.034) and renal complications (p = 0.002) during the acute infection were likely to increase risk of severe PCS (QoL <50). Vaccination and early treatment with monoclonal Ab reduced the risk of severe PCS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Interpretation Our study provides new evidence suggesting that PCS can be classified by clinical phenotypes with different impact on QoL, underlying possible different pathogenic mechanisms. We identified factors associated to each clinical phenotype and to severe PCS. These results might help in designing pathogenesis studies and in selecting high-risk patients for inclusion in therapeutic and management clinical trials.

Methods In this prospective, observational study (IDAMS), we included patients aged 5 years and older with undifferentiated fever at presentation from 26 outpatient facilities in eight countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, El Salvador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Viet Nam). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between clinical symptoms and laboratory tests with dengue versus other febrile illnesses between day 2 and day 5 after onset of fever (ie, illness days). We built a set of candidate regression models including clinical and laboratory variables to reflect the need of a comprehensive versus parsimonious approach. We assessed performance of these models via standard measures of diagnostic values. Findings Between Oct 18, 2011, and Aug 4, 2016, we recruited 7428 patients, of whom 2694 (36%) were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed dengue and 2495 (34%) with (non-dengue) other febrile illnesses and met inclusion criteria, and were included in the analysis. 2703 (52%) of 5189 included patients were younger than 15 years, 2486 (48%) were aged 15 years or older, 2179 (42%) were female and 3010 (58%) were male. Platelet count, white blood cell count, and the change in these variables from the previous day of illness had a strong association with dengue. Cough and rhinitis had strong associations with other febrile illnesses, whereas bleeding, anorexia, and skin flush were generally associated with dengue. Model performance increased between day 2 and 5 of illness. The comprehensive model (18 clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0·80 to 0·87 and specificities of 0·80 to 0·91, whereas the parsimonious model (eight clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0·80 to 0·88 and specificities of 0·81 to 0·89. A model that includes laboratory markers that are easy to measure (eg, platelet count or white blood cell count) outperformed the models based on clinical variables only. Interpretation Our results confirm the important role of platelet and white blood cell counts in diagnosing dengue, and the importance of serial measurements over subsequent days. We successfully quantified the performance of clinical and laboratory markers covering the early period of dengue. Resulting algorithms performed better than published schemes for distinction of dengue from other febrile illnesses, and take into account the dynamic changes over time.

Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue virus spread is crucial for effective prevention of future outbreaks. By investigating these patterns, targeted dengue surveillance and control measures can be improved, aiding in the management of outbreaks in dengue-affected regions. Curaçao, where dengue is endemic, has experienced frequent outbreaks over the past 25 years. To examine the spatial and temporal trends of dengue outbreaks in Curaçao, this study employs an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach. Data on >6500 cases of dengue infections in Curaçao between the years 1995 and 2016 were used. Temporal and spatial statistics were applied. The Moran's I index identified the presence of spatial autocorrelation for incident locations, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness. The majority of cases were recorded in highly populated areas and a relationship was observed between population density and dengue cases. Temporal analysis demonstrated that cases mostly occurred from October to January, during the rainy season. Lower average temperatures, higher precipitation and a lower sea surface temperature appear to be related to an increase in dengue cases. This effect has a direct link to La Niña episodes, which is the cooling phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation. The spatial and temporal analyses conducted in this study are fundamental to understanding the timing and locations of outbreaks, and ultimately improving dengue outbreak management.","2024-02-01","2024-02-09 09:33:13","2024-02-09 09:33:13","2024-02-09 09:31:51","e00338","","","24","","Parasite Epidemiol.

However, the complexities of these systems make it challenging to determine the contributions these different species make to transmission. We experimentally manipulated transmission within a natural multihost–multipathogen–multivector system, by blocking flea-borne pathogen transmission from either of two co-occurring host species (bank voles and wood mice). Through genetic analysis of the resulting infections in the hosts and vectors, we show that both host species likely act together to maintain the overall flea community, but cross-species pathogen transmission is relatively rare—most pathogens were predominantly found in only one host species, and there were few cases where targeted treatment affected pathogens in the other host species. However, we do provide experimental evidence of some reservoir–spillover dynamics whereby reductions of some infections in one host species are achieved by blocking transmission from the other host species. Overall, despite the apparent complexity of such systems, we show there can be ‘covert simplicity’, whereby pathogen transmission is primarily dominated by single host species, potentially facilitating the targeting of key hosts for control, even in diverse ecological communities.","2023-11-15","2024-02-09 14:22:55","2024-02-09 14:22:55","2024-02-09 14:22:14","20231900","","2011","290","","Proc.

Pratylenchus loosi belongs to the order Rhabditida, subfamily Pratylenchidae. This nematode is not known to be present in the EU. The species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. The pest occurs primarily in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate areas. It is widely distributed in Asian countries, with tea plants (Camellia sinensis) as the main host. The pest was reported from more than 60 plant species, but reports from hosts other than C. sinensis, e.g. citrus (Citrus spp.) and banana (Musa spp.), are associated with high uncertainty due to doubtful pest identification. Morphological and molecular methods are available for the identification of the pest. Pathways of entry are host plants for planting except seeds, as well as soil attached to plants for planting, machinery or footwear. Soil import to the EU is prohibited from third countries. The climatic preferences of P. loosi are compatible with the microclimatic conditions occurring in the areas of the EU where tea is grown outside. The impact of the nematode is primarily known for Asian countries, where it is a devastating pathogen on tea plants, but there is a key uncertainty on impacts on hosts other than tea. Considering the strong pathogenicity of the pest, its establishment in tea producing areas would have negative consequences for tea producers. Therefore, the Panel concludes that P. loosi satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2024","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 15:59:54","e8548","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

M. parallela is commonly known as the mountain ring silk moth and is a polyphagous leaf-eating pest in west-central Asia, primarily feeding on deciduous trees and shrubs, and known to cause serious damage to Malus, Prunus, and Quercus species. It is found at a range of altitudes from 130 m to 3000 m although most common above 1000 m. It is a univoltine species. Eggs are laid in masses on twigs and branches in the summer and larvae hatch the following spring to feed on buds and fresh leaves. Host plants can be completely defoliated. Plants for planting and cut branches provide pathways for entry, especially if infested with egg masses. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that parts of the EU would be suitable for establishment. Adults can fly and the pest could spread naturally within the EU although adults only live for a few days. Faster and more extensive spread is therefore more likely via egg masses moved on plants for planting. The introduction of M. parallela into the EU could lead to outbreaks causing damage to deciduous trees and shrubs in forests and orchards.

Commonly known as the Asian walnut moth, this pest is native to Central Asia and develops on shoots, buds and fruits of Juglans species such as the English walnut, J. regia and the black walnut, J. nigra. Other reported host plants, such as Prunus dulcis and Populus spp., still require confirmation. The pest was first recorded in the EU (Bulgaria) in 2016 and was then reported in Romania in 2018 and Italy in 2021. This moth completes from one to four generations per year depending on environmental conditions (from valley to mountain forests and orchards up to an altitude of 2100 m). Eggs are laid in groups of 2–3 on young nuts or on buds of 1-year-old shoots. Neonate larvae usually enter the young nut through the peduncle. After fully exploiting one nut, the larva continues feeding in another one. Development takes 25–40 days. Larvae of the autumn generation do not enter the nuts, and so feed only in the pericarp. Larvae also often feed inside 1-year-old shoots or leaf axils. Larvae develop within the host but exit to pupate under loose bark or in deep cracks of bark. The pest overwinters at the larval or pupal stages. Plants for planting, cut branches and infested nuts provide pathways for entry. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern and central EU MSs have allowed this species to establish and spread in Bulgaria, Romania and Italy. Adults can fly and the pest could spread naturally within the EU. Impact on Juglans spp. cultivated for fruit, timber and ornamental purposes is anticipated. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread of G. musculana.

U. japonicus occurs across Japan and on the Korean Peninsula. It attacks fallen or weakened Japanese cedars, Cryptomeria japonica and Japanese cypresses, Chamaecyparis obtusa. It has also been observed attacking Pinus spp., Abies spp., Larix kaempferi and Picea jezoensis. The females oviposit into the sapwood. Eggs are deposited together with a symbiotic basidiomycete fungus, Amylostereum laevigatum. The larvae feed on wood infected by the fungus. All immature stages live in the hosts sapwood. The lifecycle of the pest lasts 1 year, sometimes 2 years. The wood of the host trees is discoloured by the fungus and therefore loses much of its economic value.

U. albicornis occurs throughout Canada and continental USA and has established in northern Spain, and probably in southern France (based on two specimens caught in two sites) and Japan (based on one individual caught in one site). It attacks mostly stumps or fallen or weakened trees of at least 20 species of Pinaceae (Abies spp., Larix spp., Picea spp., Pinus spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga spp.) and of Cupressaceae (Thuja plicata). In Spain, the females fly between May and September with a peak in August and September. The eggs are deposited into the sapwood, together with mucus containing a venom and a white-rot wood-decay basidiomycete, either Amylostereum chailletii or A. areolatum. Each fungus is symbiotic with the insect. The larvae feed on wood infected by the fungus. All immature stages live in the host sapwood.

P. shantungensis is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is polyphagous, feeding on plants belonging to more than 200 species including many crop and ornamental plants. Economically important hosts in the EU include apple (M. domestica), citrus (Citrus spp.), walnut (Castanea sp.) and ornamentals such as hibiscus (Hibiscus spp.) and camellia (Camellia japonica), as well as forest trees, mostly deciduous. In the Republic of Korea, the species has one generation per year. It overwinters as eggs and goes through five nymphal instars. Its impact is due to oviposition obstructing the vascular system of its hosts, depletion of the host resources and egestion of honeydew promoting the development of sooty moulds. Plants for planting constitute the main pathway for entry into the EU and for spread. Climatic conditions in southern EU countries and host plant availability in those areas would allow establishment and spread. The introduction of P. shantungensis is expected to have an economic impact in the EU through the reduction in yield, quality and commercial value of fruits and ornamental plants. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread. P. shantungensis meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2023","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 15:58:34","e08320","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 European Food Safety Authority.

It is native to Central America and since the 1990s, it has spread rapidly in mainly tropical areas of the Caribbean, islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, Africa and southern Asia. Large populations were detected in northern Israel in 2016. It has not been reported within the EU. It is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It reproduces sexually and there are up to 11 generations per year in India. The estimated minimum, optimum and maximum temperature thresholds for the adult females are 13.9, 28.4 and 32.1°C, respectively. First-instar nymphs may move to neighbouring plants by crawling, or be passively dispersed by wind, or hitchhiking on clothing, equipment or animals. It is highly polyphagous, feeding on plants in 172 genera and 54 families. It is an important pest of custard apple (Annona spp.), papaya (Carica papaya) and Hibiscus spp. It also feeds on a wide range of plants cultivated in the EU such as eggplant (Solanum melongena), avocado (Persea americana), citrus (Citrus spp.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), guava (Psidium guajava), mango (Mangifera indica), passionfruit (Passiflora edulis), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Plants for planting, fruits, vegetables and cut flowers are the main potential pathways for entry of P. marginatus into the EU. Climatic conditions in the warmest areas of Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain, where host plants occur, would likely allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Reductions in yield and quality of some cultivated hosts including Annona spp., Hibiscus spp. and papaya are anticipated if establishment occurs.

D. punctatus, also known as the Masson pine caterpillar, is present in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, India and has recently spread to Japanese islands close to Taiwan. Larval feeding on the needles of Pinus elliottii, P. luchuensis, P. massoniana, P. merkusii and P. tabulaeformis causes important damage. D. punctatus larvae can also feed on P. armandii, P. echinata, P. latteri, P. parviflora, P. sylvestris var. mongolica, P. taeda, P. taiwanensis and P. thunbergii, but full development on these hosts is uncertain. The pest has three to five generations per year; winter is spent as larvae on branch tips, on tree trunks and in the soil. The females lay egg clusters on pine needles. Pupation occurs in cocoons attached to branches or needles. D. punctatus could enter the EU either as eggs, larvae or pupae in the foliage of plants for planting or cut branches, as larvae on wood with bark or as overwintering larvae in branches, crevices in the bark or in the litter of potted plants. However, Annex VI of 2019/2072 prohibits the introduction of D. punctatus hosts (Pinus spp.) from countries and areas where the pest occurs. There are climate zones where the pest occurs in Asia that also occur in the EU, though they are limited, which constitutes an uncertainty regarding establishment. The pest's main hosts are not grown in the EU. However, the fact that it attacks the North American Pinus echinata, P. elliottii and P. taeda in its Asian native area suggests a potential capacity to shift to pine species occurring in the EU territory. D. punctatus satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. Whether the Pinus commonly found in Europe could act as hosts is unknown but is fundamental, affecting the criteria of establishment and magnitude of impact.","2024","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 16:04:34","2024-03-18 16:00:00","e8504","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

S. invicta is native to central South America and has spread to North and Central America, East Asia and Australia where it is recognised as a major invasive species causing serious environmental impacts to biodiversity and harming horticultural crops such as cabbage, eggplant and potatoes. It can girdle and kill young citrus trees. S. invicta is not listed as a Union quarantine pest in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. However, the European Scientific Forum on Invasive Alien Species lists S. invicta as a species of Union concern (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1203). Like other ant species, S. invicta is a social insect commonly creating colonies in the soil. Long-distance spread in the Americas has been attributed to nests being carried in soil accompanying plants for planting, or simply in soil alone. S. invicta could enter the EU via conveyances carrying a wide range of goods if the conveyance is contaminated with soil or has been in close contact with soil, and with plants for planting in soil or growing media. Climatic conditions in large parts of the southern EU are suitable for establishment and spread would occur when mated females disperse to form new colonies. If S. invicta established in the EU, losses to horticultural crops would be expected in addition to losses to biodiversity. The impacts of S. invicta go beyond plant health with the ant attacking new-born, hatching, weak or sick animals. Stings can cause allergic reactions in humans and are a public health issue. However, such factors are outside the scope of a pest categorisation.

N. lugens is widespread in Asia where it is native; it also occurs in Oceania where it is naturalised. N. lugens is not known to be present in the EU and is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is a monophagous species and a major pest of rice (Oryza sativa). High populations of planthoppers cause leaves to initially turn orange yellow before becoming brown and dry and this is a condition called ‘hopperburn’ that kills the plant. N. lugens can also transmit plant viruses. It can complete 12 generations per year in tropical areas, where it resides year-round. N. lugens can undertake long-distance migration of up to 500 km from tropical areas to form transient populations in sub-tropical and temperate areas but due to low temperatures and absence of rice plants during the winter it does not establish in such areas. Entry to the EU via migration is unlikely given the distance from tropical rice growing areas. A possible but unlikely potential pathway is the import of infested rice seedlings, although we have no evidence that such trade exists. In the EU, rice is mainly planted from seed; when transplanted, it is sourced locally. N. lugens is very unlikely to survive year-round in the EU due to unsuitable climate and lack of hosts during the winter. Consequently, the pest is very unlikely to become established in the EU territory. Nevertheless, there are measures available to further reduce the likelihood of entry, establishment and spread of N. lugens within the EU.

This is a lawn grass grown in warm, tropical and subtropical regions of the world and which is widely grown in the southern US and also used in southern EU as a lawn and amenity grass. Adults and nymphs aggregate to feed at the base of the grass. B. insularis occurs in the southern continental US, Hawaii, Guam, Mexico, Central and South America, and across the Caribbean. In the EU, B. insularis was first detected in Portugal in 2019, where following a national survey, it has now been found in 10 municipalities across the central and southern parts of the country. The pathway for entry into Portugal is unknown. B. insularis is not a regulated pest in the EU. It could further enter and spread within the EU via the import and movement of host plants for planting. S. secundatum is vegetatively propagated because seed is largely sterile. Many Poaceae plants for planting are prohibited from entering the EU, other than some ornamental perennial grasses. Whether S. secundatum is considered an ornamental grass within phytosanitary legislation is not clear. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that southern EU regions extending from the Atlantic coast of Portugal through the Mediterranean would be suitable for B. insularis establishment. The introduction of B. insularis to such areas of the EU would likely cause impacts to St. Augustine grass, as already seen in Portugal. Measures to prevent further entry and spread are available.

In the Mediterranean basin it is found in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Syria and Turkey, where it is limited to the Marmara region. It has not been reported within the EU. It is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It reproduces sexually, has three generations each year in citrus orchards in South Africa, and all stages can overwinter. First instar nymphs may move to neighbouring plants by crawling or be passively dispersed by wind or hitchhiking on clothing, equipment or animals. It is highly polyphagous, feeding on plants in 115 genera and 46 families. It is an important pest of citrus (Citrus spp.), cotton (Gossypium spp.), mango (Mangifera indica), avocado (Persea americana) and stored potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). It also feeds on a wide range of other fruit (apple Malus domestica, olive Olea europea, pear Pyrus communis and grape Vitis vinifera) and vegetable crops (tomato Solanum lycopersicum), and ornamental plants (roses, Rosa spp.) that are widely grown in the EU. Plants for planting, fruits, vegetables, and cut flowers are the main potential pathways for entry of N. viridis into the EU. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern parts of the EU where there are few days of frost each year would likely allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Reductions in yield and quality of cultivated hosts including avocado, citrus, cotton and mango is anticipated if establishment occurs.

M. testaceipes occurs in Japan, northeast China, Far East Russia, South Korea and very likely North Korea. Adults are recognised pests feeding on and damaging the needles of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) which are important forestry trees where the pest currently occurs. It has adapted to feed on the needles of Pinus species introduced into its native area, such as P. taeda, which is native to southeastern USA although M. testaceipes is not regarded as a significant pest of pines. Larvae are reported to cause root damage to grasses, as well as conifers. Eggs are usually laid in grassy soils by females that develop on conifer species. Larvae develop in the soil feeding on the roots of grasses or conifer hosts. Larvae overwinter in the soil and take 2 or 3 years to develop. In principle soil, host plants for planting and cut branches with foliage could provide pathways into the EU. However, prohibitions on the import of soil and hosts such as Chamaecyparis, Larix and Pinus regulate such pathways into the EU. Nevertheless, certain dwarfed Pinus spp. from Japan are provided with a derogation for entry into the EU. In addition, the host C. japonica is unregulated and could also provide a pathway. Hosts occur in the EU in climate zones that match those where M. testaceipes occurs in Asia. If M. testaceipes were to enter the EU, conditions in central and northern EU are conducive to establishment. Following establishment, impacts on Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress and Japanese larch would be expected; it is possible that M. testaceipes could adapt to feed on Pinus and Larix species growing in Europe.

These benefits are important to consider during a spatial planning process. For spatial prioritisation of sites with a high societal importance, there is need to filter this information to insightful spatial indicators. The mapping of ES-hotspots and identification of ES-bundles have been put forward as promising methods for spatial prioritisation and the assessment of multifunctionality. While “hotspot mapping” and “ES-bundles” speak to the imagination of many, it is open to many different interpretations. In addition, there is a risk that the commonly applied hotspot mapping of single services and subsequent overlay analysis does not capture true hotspots of multifunctionality, where we expect multiple services to co-occur, but at lower intensities. Therefore, hotspot mapping should be applied on ES-bundles, rather than single ES. Yet, there are few methods to objectively identify and map such bundles of co-occurring services. In this research we propose dimension reduction principal component analysis (PCA), as a solution to identify and map bundles of ES. This technique is an established technique in remote sensing, where it is used to reduce unnecessary clutter in a data set. This research shows that if the methods for quantification and mapping of ES are sufficiently independent and biophysically sound, the PCA method can reveal multifunctionality between services and lead to (new) insights that can be used for better informed decisions on management and planning. The PCA graphs, ES-bundle maps and the integrated RGB-visualisation are objective and factual outputs of a statistical analysis that can be used for communication and discussion with stakeholders. It gives insight in co-occurrence of services and challenges to look for answers to why things are the way they are. Although scale effects did not play an important role in the results of this study, we advise to use this method on relatively small scales and repeat analysis rather than generalizing large scale results to the local scale or transfer findings between study sites as land-use patterns (and its interplay with abiotic conditions) are the result of many different socio-ecological developments throughout history, which can obviously differ from region to region.","2018-04-01","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 13:59:51","209-260","","","87","","Ecol.

Autonomous wireless sensor networks (WSN) are providing a way forward by reducing the need for manual offload and maintenance; however, there is still a significant gap in pest management using WSN with most applications failing to provide a low-cost, autonomous monitoring system that can operate in remote areas. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of implementing a reliable, fully independent, low-power WSN that will provide high-resolution, near-real-time input to a spatial decision support system (SDSS), capturing the small-scale heterogeneity needed for intelligent IPM. The WSN hosts a dual-uplink taking advantage of both satellite and terrestrial communication. A set of tests were conducted to assess metrics such as signal strength, data transmission and bandwidth of the SatCom module as well as mesh configuration, energetic autonomy, point to point communication and data loss of the WSN nodes. Finally, we demonstrate the SDSS output from two vector models forced by WSN data from a field site in Belgium. We believe that this system can be a cost-effective solution for intelligent IPM in remote areas where there is no reliable terrestrial connection.","2019","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:00:39","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY 4.0)","","","","biblio.ugent.be","","Number: 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Germany, this pathogen is transmitted primarily by Ixodes ricinus. There is limited knowledge about its prevalence in horses in Germany. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the results of serological and molecular testing for A. phagocytophilum in horses which were done in a commercial laboratory in Germany over fourteen years. Additionally, risk factors were evaluated, and hematological abnormalities were addressed in horses with positive PCR results. Methods This retrospective study examined results of direct (Polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and indirect (immunofluorescence antibody test [IFAT]) detection methods for A. phagocytophilum in horses on samples provided by German veterinarians and processed by the commercial laboratory LABOKLIN from 2008 to 2021. In horses with positive test results, a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) were also analyzed where possible. Results In total, 1217/4834 horses tested positive (PCR: 190/1246 horses, 15.2%; IFAT: 1036/3849 horses, 26.9%). Seasonality and location, as classified by federal state, had a statistically significant impact on PCR results (P < 0.001 for both). In horses with positive PCR results, hematological abnormalities were detected in 112/118 horses (95%), with thrombocytopenia (86%) and anemia (52%) representing the most common findings. The remaining 6/118 horses (5%) showed no hematological abnormalities on CBC. SAA was measured in 35 horses with positive PCR results, which exclusively showed marked elevation. Conclusions The seasonality of A. phagocytophilum infections confirmed by PCR testing was consistent with known peaks in vector activity in Germany. The high rate of horses with positive PCR results when compared to dogs and cats may be due to a lack of ectoparasite prophylaxis. Infections with A. phagocytophilum should be considered as a differential diagnosis in horses with cytopenia on CBC and SAA elevation, especially in the summer and after any possible tick exposure.","2022-12-01","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:00:42","109840","","","312","","Vet.

Understanding their distributions is a key means of assessing risk. VectorNet maps their distribution in the EU and surrounding areas. Aim We aim to describe the methodology underlying VectorNet maps, encourage standardisation and evaluate output. Method s: Vector distribution and surveillance activity data have been collected since 2010 from a combination of literature searches, field-survey data by entomologist volunteers via a network facilitated for each participating country and expert validation. Data were collated by VectorNet members and extensively validated during data entry and mapping processes. Results As of 2021, the VectorNet archive consisted of ca 475,000 records relating to &gt; 330 species. Maps for 42 species are routinely produced online at subnational administrative unit resolution. On VectorNet maps, there are relatively few areas where surveillance has been recorded but there are no distribution data. Comparison with other continental databases, namely the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and VectorBase show that VectorNet has 5–10 times as many records overall, although three species are better represented in the other databases. In addition, VectorNet maps show where species are absent. VectorNet’s impact as assessed by citations (ca 60 per year) and web statistics (58,000 views) is substantial and its maps are widely used as reference material by professionals and the public. Conclusion VectorNet maps are the pre-eminent source of rigorously validated arthropod vector maps for Europe and its surrounding areas.","2023-06-29","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:00:46","2200666","","26","28","","","VectorNet","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.eurosurveillance.org","","Publisher: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modelling the spatial distribution of this parasite can help to improve its management in higher risk regions. The aim of this research was to assess the constraints of using historical data sets when modelling the spatial distribution of helminth parasites in ruminants. A parasitological data set provided by CREMOPAR (Napoli, Italy) and covering most of Italy was used in this paper. A baseline model (Random Forest, VECMAP<sup>®<sup/>) using the entire data set was first used to determine the minimal number of data points needed to build a stable model. Then, annual distribution models were computed and compared with the baseline model. The best prediction rate and statistical output were obtained for 2012 and the worst for 2016, even though the sample size of the former was significantly smaller than the latter. We discuss how this may be explained by the fact that in 2012, the samples were more evenly geographically distributed, whilst in 2016 most of the data were strongly clustered. It is concluded that the spatial distribution of the input data appears to be more important than the actual sample size when computing species distribution models. This is often a major issue when using historical data to develop spatial models. Such data sets often include sampling biases and large geographical gaps. If this bias is not corrected, the spatial distribution model outputs may display the sampling effort rather than the real species distribution.","2021","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 13:59:47","46","","","28","","Parasite","","","","","","","","en","© A.

Understanding the population dynamics characteristics of vector species is of pivotal importance to optimise surveillance and control activities, to estimate risk for pathogen-transmission, and thus to enhance support of public health decisions. In this paper we used a seasonal activity model to simulate the start (spring hatching) and end (autumn diapause) of the vector season. In parallel, the peak abundance of the species was assessed using both VectorNet field survey data complemented with field studies obtained from literature across the Mediterranean Basin. Our results suggest that spring hatching of eggs in the current distribution area can start at the beginning of March in southern Europe and in April in western Europe. In northern Europe, where the species is not (yet) present, spring hatching would occur from late April to late May. Aedes albopictus can remain active up to 41 weeks in southern Europe whilst the climatic conditions in northern Europe are limiting its potential activity to a maximum of 23 weeks. The peak of egg density is found during summer months from end of July until end of September. During these two months the climatic conditions for species development are optimal, which implies a higher risk for arbovirus transmission by Ae. albopictus and occurrence of epidemics.","2021-05-14","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 13:59:54","","","1","16","","Geospat.

Resident grouse and migratory birds play a significant role as amplifying hosts and various mosquito species, including Aedes cinereus, Culex pipiens, Cx. torrentium and Culiseta morsitans are documented vectors. As specific treatments are not available for SINV infections, and joint symptoms may persist, the public health burden is considerable in endemic areas. To predict the environmental suitability for SINV infections in Finland, we applied a suite of geospatial and statistical modeling techniques to disease occurrence data. Using an ensemble approach, we first produced environmental suitability maps for potential SINV vectors in Finland. These suitability maps were then combined with grouse densities and environmental data to identify the influential determinants for SINV infections and to predict the risk of Pogosta disease in Finnish municipalities. Our predictions suggest that both the environmental suitability for vectors and the high risk of Pogosta disease are focused in geographically restricted areas. This provides evidence that the presence of both SINV vector species and grouse densities can predict the occurrence of the disease. The results support material for public-health officials when determining area-specific recommendations and deliver information to health care personnel to raise awareness of the disease among physicians.","2021-01","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:00:44","7064","","13","18","","Int.

Mosquitoes are responsible for about half a million deaths and 4.5 million disability-adjusted life years annually. Urbanization, globalization, and climate change are expected to increase the global vector-borne disease (VBD) burden in the coming decades. The time of occurrence, abundance, and activity of mosquito vectors are all influenced by environmental conditions. In the current context of climate change, it is critical to analyze the impact of shifts in climatic conditions on the suitability of vector species for establishment and annual activity. Furthermore, changes in the unpredictability of meteorological factors and their extremes might cause unanticipated changes in the mosquito vector population and, subsequently, the spread of VBD. One way to put these causes and effects into perspective is to simulate the activity of the vector within a multifaceted framework which allows for the analysis of the contribution of individual factors on the activity of the vector and the spread of disease. The employment of both dynamical and geographic information system (GIS) models replicating the properties of the real biological population, driven by remote sensing data, provides such a solution. In this chapter, we describe various modeling approaches that contribute to the better understanding of VBD risk using Aedes mosquitoes in Europe as our main example. We review the multiple ways different abiotic data and derived environmental and meteorological covariates can contribute to assess the risk and potential impact of VBDs. First, we discuss the relationship of vectors, pathogens, and hosts with their environment and how this affects or limits how meteorological covariate data can contribute to map these VBD components. Based on this, we discuss how different covariate data can be used in a variety of methods for the spatial mapping and modeling of these components at a variety of scales. We proceed with describing the current state of the art in geospatial modeling of invasive Aedes vectors in Europe and expected shifts under different climate change scenarios. Finally, we discuss techniques for modeling the distribution of the coupled mosquito–mosquito transmitted diseases system. In conclusion, a summary is given of best practice modeling approaches and specific modeling needs.","2023-01-01","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:04:25","2024-04-11 14:00:05","63-88","","","","","","Geospatial modeling of invasive <i>Aedes</i> vectors in Europe and the diseases they transmit","Earth Observation","","","","Elsevier","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-323-98983-1.00005-3","","","","","climate change; Modeling; vector-borne disease; remote sensing; geostatistical analysis; one health","Stathopoulos, Nikolaos; Tsatsaris, Andreas; Kalogeropoulos, Kleomenis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This novel trait offers a unique opportunity to understand the mechanisms of bare-part coloration in birds. To identify the mutation producing the colorful phenotype, we resequenced the genome of urucum canaries and performed a range of analyses to search for genotype-to-phenotype associations across the genome. We identified a nonsynonymous mutation in the gene BCO2 (beta-carotene oxygenase 2, also known as BCDO2), an enzyme involved in the cleavage and breakdown of full-length carotenoids into short apocarotenoids. Protein structural models and in vitro functional assays indicate that the urucum mutation abrogates the carotenoid-cleavage activity of BCO2. Consistent with the predicted loss of carotenoid-cleavage activity, urucum canaries tended to have increased levels of full-length carotenoid pigments in bill tissue and reduced levels of carotenoid-cleavage products (apocarotenoids) in retinal tissue compared with other breeds of canaries. We hypothesize that carotenoid-based bare-part coloration might be readily gained, modified, or lost through simple switches in the enzymatic activity or regulation of BCO2 and this gene may be an important mediator in the evolution of bare-part coloration among bird species.","2020-05-01","2024-06-11 06:58:45","2024-06-11 06:59:47","2024-06-11 06:58:45","1317-1328","","5","37","","Mol.

However, this drug is toxic and has a limited effectiveness on the chronic phase of this disease, often leading to poor treatment adherence. METHODS:: This is a descriptive and exploratory study conducted at the Pharmaceutical Care Service for Chagas disease patients of the Federal University of Ceará. Drug-related problems (DRPs) and pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) were classified according to the Second Consensus of Granada. RESULTS:: The average age of patients with Chagas disease was 62 years, with the majority residing in the Ceará countryside (86.7%), and having low education levels (63.3% with elementary school education). Regarding family income, most patients belonged to a household that earned ≤1-2 times the minimum wage per month. Approximately 73% of these patients complied with the BNZ treatment, and nearly 7% underwent therapy interruption after medical evaluation. A total of 189 DRPs were identified, of which 51.9% (n=98) were classified as potential, and 48.1% (n=91) as actual. The most frequent DRPs were related to safety (qualitative safety; n=70; 37%), necessity (non-adherence; n=52; 27.5%), and effectiveness (qualitative effectiveness/non-optimal drug selection; n=45; 23.8%). Among the 216 PIs conducted, the majority were related to patient education (n=168; 77.8%) and pharmacological strategy (n=42; 19.4%).

About 30% of infected patients will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocarditis. Further studies are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease progression. Transcriptome analysis has been increasingly used to identify molecular changes associated with disease outcomes. We thus assessed the whole-blood transcriptome of patients with Chagas disease. Microarray analysis was performed on blood samples from 150 subjects, of whom 30 were uninfected control patients and 120 had Chagas disease (1 group had asymptomatic disease, and 2 groups had CCC with either a preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each Chagas disease group displayed distinct gene expression and functional pathway profiles. The most different expression patterns were between CCC groups with a preserved or reduced LVEF. A more stringent analysis indicated that 27 differentially expressed genes, particularly those related to natural killer (NK)/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, separated the 2 groups. NK/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity could play a role in determining Chagas disease progression. Understanding genes associated with disease may lead to improved insight into CCC pathogenesis and the identification of prognostic factors for CCC progression. © The Author 2016.

More nymphs were collected than adults, and the greatest number of triatomines (n = 8,548) was collected in 2010, for which the infection rate was 1.3%, with the highest rate of infections observed for specimens from Quixere. The species collected during the study were identified as Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma brasiliensis, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus, with T. pseudomaculata being the most abundant (n = 19,962). CONCLUSIONS: These results verify the presence of triatomines in both intra- and peridomiciliary areas, thereby ensuring persistence of the pathogen and consequently, the disease, as the presence of infected vectors in households is an important risk factor. According to these findings, the Chagas Disease Control Program should intensify its efforts in order to prevent the spread of the disease.","2018-04","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-10-22 13:57:16","2023-12-20","174-182","","2","51","","Rev.

Most DENV cases in the Americas between January and July 2019 were reported in Brazil. São Paulo State in the southeast of Brazil has reported nearly half of all DENV infections in the country. OBJECTIVES To understand the origin and dynamics of the 2019 DENV outbreak. METHODS Here using portable nanopore sequencing we generated20 new DENV genome sequences from viremic patients with suspected dengue infection residing in two of the most-affected municipalities of São Paulo State, Araraquara and São José do Rio Preto. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with 1,630 global DENV strains to better understand the evolutionary history of the DENV lineages that currently circulate in the region. FINDINGS The new outbreak strains were classified as DENV2 genotype III (American/Asian genotype). Our analysis shows that the 2019 outbreak is the result of a novel DENV lineage that was recently introduced to Brazil from the Caribbean region. Dating phylogeographic analysis suggests that DENV2-III BR-4 was introduced to Brazil in or around early 2014, possibly from the Caribbean region. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our study describes the early detection of a newly introduced and rapidly-expanding DENV2 virus lineage in Brazil.","2020-05-15","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-10-22 13:56:41","2024-02-28","e190423","","","115","","Mem.

Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.

Little is known about the role of rare genetic variants in inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC) is an inflammatory cardiomyopathy prevalent in Latin America, developing in 30% of the 6 million patients chronically infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, while 60% remain free of heart disease (asymptomatic (ASY)). The cytokine interferon-γ and mitochondrial dysfunction are known to play a major pathogenetic role. Chagas disease provides a unique model to probe for genetic variants involved in inflammatory cardiomyopathy. METHODS: We used whole exome sequencing to study nuclear families containing multiple cases of Chagas disease. We searched for rare pathogenic variants shared by all family members with CCC but absent in infected ASY siblings and in unrelated ASY. RESULTS: We identified heterozygous, pathogenic variants linked to CCC in all tested families on 22 distinct genes, from which 20 were mitochondrial or inflammation-related - most of the latter involved in proinflammatory cytokine production. Significantly, incubation with IFN-γ on a human cardiomyocyte line treated with an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase brequinar (enzyme showing a loss-of-function variant in one family) markedly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔψM), indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation may be genetically determined in CCC, driven by rare genetic variants. We hypothesize that CCC-linked genetic variants increase mitochondrial susceptibility to IFN-γ-induced damage in the myocardium, leading to the cardiomyopathy phenotype in Chagas disease. This mechanism may also be operative in other inflammatory cardiomyopathies.","2021-07","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-10-22 13:55:47","2024-01-05","1048-1063","","5","41","","J. Clin.

Here we used individual-level patient records after hospitalization with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 20 January 2020 and 26 July 2021 to document temporary, sweeping shocks in hospital fatality rates that followed the spread of Gamma across 14 state capitals, during which typically more than half of hospitalized patients aged 70 years and older died. We show that such extensive shocks in COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates also existed before the detection of Gamma. Using a Bayesian fatality rate model, we found that the geographic and temporal fluctuations in Brazil's COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates were primarily associated with geographic inequities and shortages in healthcare capacity. We estimate that approximately half of the COVID-19 deaths in hospitals in the 14 cities could have been avoided without pre-pandemic geographic inequities and without pandemic healthcare pressure.

Our analyses demonstrated the circulation of B.1 lineage isolates in the investigated locations and nucleotide substitutions were observed into the genomic regions related to important viral structures. Additionally, sequences generated in this study clustered with isolates from SP, suggesting a dissemination route between these two states. Alternatively, monophyletic groups of sequences from MG and other states or country were observed, indicating independent events of virus introduction. These results reinforce the need of genomic surveillance for understand the ongoing spread of emerging viral pathogens. Copyright © 2022 International Alliance for Biological Standardization.

It is clinically divided into three phases: acute, post-acute and chronic. Chronic cases correspond to 25-40% individuals and, though most of them are characterized by long-lasting arthralgia alone, many of them exhibit persistent or recurrent inflammatory signs that define post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory joint disease (pCHIKV-CIJD). We aimed to identify early clinical markers of evolution to pCHIKV-CIJD during acute and post-acute phases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied a prospective cohort of CHIKF-confirmed volunteers with longitudinal clinical data collection from symptoms onset up to 90 days, including a 21-day visit (D21). Of 169 patients with CHIKF, 86 (50.9%) completed the follow-up, from whom 39 met clinical criteria for pCHIKV-CIJD (45.3%). The relative risk of chronification was higher in women compared to men (RR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.15-1.99; FDR = 0.03). None of the symptoms or signs presented at D0 behaved as an early predictor of pCHIKV-CIJD, while being symptomatic at D21 was a risk factor for chronification (RR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.09-1.55; FDR = 0.03). Significance was also observed for joint pain (RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.12-1.61; FDR = 0.02), reported edema (RR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.44-9.06; FDR = 0.03), reported hand and/or feet small joints edema (RR = 4.22; 95% CI = 1.51-11.78; FDR = 0.02), and peri-articular edema observed during physical examination (RR = 2.89; 95% CI = 1.58-5.28; FDR = 0.002). Furthermore, patients with no findings in physical examination at D21 were at lower risk of chronic evolution (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.24-0.70, FDR = 0.01). Twenty-nine pCHIKV-CIJD patients had abnormal articular ultrasonography (90.6% of the examined). The most common findings were synovitis (65.5%) and joint effusion (58.6%). CONCLUSION: This cohort has provided important insights into the prognostic evaluation of CHIKF. Symptomatic sub-acute disease is a relevant predictor of evolution to chronic arthritis with synovitis, drawing attention to joint pain, edema, multiple articular involvement including small hand and feet joints as risk factors for chronification beyond three months, especially in women. Future studies are needed to accomplish the identification of accurate and early biomarkers of poor clinical prognosis, which would allow better understanding of the disease's evolution and improve patients' management, modifying CHIKF burden on global public health.

In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed < 15% of Delta exports and South Africa < 1%-2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility.

MicroRNAs (microRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that downregulate messenger RNA/protein expression of innumerous molecules and are critical for homeostasis. We investigated whether OT in kidney transplantation displays a differential microRNA profile, which would suggest that microRNAs participate in Operational Tolerance mechanisms, and may reveal potential molecular pathways. Methods: We first compared serum microRNA in OT (n = 8) with chronic rejection (CR) (n = 5) and healthy individuals (HI) (n = 5), using a 768-microRNA qPCR-panel. We used the Thermo Fisher Cloud computing platform to compare the levels of microRNAs in the OT group in relation to the other study groups. We performed validation experiments for miR-885-5p, by q-PCR, in a larger number of study subjects (OT = 8, CR = 12, HI = 12), as individual samples. Results: We detected a differential microRNA profile in OT vs. its opposing clinical outcome-CR-suggesting that microRNAs may integrate transplantation tolerance mechanisms. Some miRNAs were detected at higher levels in OT: miR-885-5p, miR-331-3p, miR-27a-5p vs. CR; others, we found at lower levels: miR-1233-3p, miR-572, miR-638, miR-1260a. Considering highly predicted/experimentally demonstrated targets of these miRNAs, bioinformatics analysis revealed that the granzyme B, and death receptor pathways are dominant, suggesting that cell death regulation integrates transplantation tolerance mechanisms. We confirmed higher miR-885-5p levels in OT vs. CR, and vs. HI, in a larger number of subjects. Conclusions: We propose that epigenetics mechanisms involving microRNAs may integrate human transplantation tolerance mechanisms, and regulate key members of the cell death/survival signaling. miR-885-5p could favor cell survival in OT by diminishing the levels of CRADD/RAIDD and CASP3. Nonetheless, given the nature of any complex phenomenon in humans, only cumulative data will help to determine whether this microRNA differential profile may be related to the cause or consequence of operational tolerance.","2019-04-25","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-01-05","740","","","10","","Front.

We aimed to investigate the emergence and circulation of Zika virus in Angola. METHODS: Diagnostic samples collected by the Angolan Ministry of Health as part of routine arboviral surveillance were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR by the Instituto Nacional de Investigação em Saúde (Ministry of Health, Luanda, Angola). To identify further samples positive for Zika virus and appropriate for genomic sequencing, we also tested samples from a 2017 study of people with HIV in Luanda. Portable sequencing was used to generate Angolan Zika virus genome sequences from three people positive for Zika virus infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR, including one neonate with microcephaly. Genetic and mobility data were analysed to investigate the date of introduction and geographical origin of Zika virus in Angola. Brain CT and MRI, and serological assays were done on a child with microcephaly to confirm microcephaly and assess previous Zika virus infection. FINDINGS: Serum samples from 54 people with suspected acute Zika virus infection, 76 infants with suspected microcephaly, 24 mothers of infants with suspected microcephaly, 336 patients with suspected dengue virus or chikungunya virus infection, and 349 samples from the HIV study were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Four cases identified between December, 2016, and June, 2017, tested positive for Zika virus. Analyses of viral genomic and human mobility data suggest that Zika virus was probably introduced to Angola from Brazil between July, 2015, and June, 2016. This introduction probably initiated local circulation of Zika virus in Angola that continued until at least June, 2017. The infant with microcephaly in whom CT and MRI were done had brain abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika syndrome and serological evidence for Zika virus infection. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses show that autochthonous transmission of the Asian lineage of Zika virus has taken place in Africa. Zika virus surveillance and surveillance of associated cases of microcephaly throughout the continent is crucial.

Genome sequencing as an approach for monitoring circulating viruses is currently hampered by complex and expensive methods. Untargeted, metagenomic nanopore sequencing can provide genomic information to identify pathogens, prepare for or even prevent outbreaks. SMART (Switching Mechanism at the 5′ end of RNA Template) is a popular method for RNA-Seq but most current methods rely on oligo-dT priming to target polyadenylated mRNA molecules. We have developed two random primed SMART-Seq approaches, ‘SMART-9N’, and a version compatible with barcoded PCR primers available from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ‘Rapid SMART-9N’, for the detection, characterization, and whole-genome sequencing of RNA viruses. The methods were developed using viral isolates, clinical samples, and compared to a gold-standard amplicon-based method. From a Zika virus isolate the SMART-9N approach recovered 10kb of the 10.8kb RNA genome in a single nanopore read. We also obtained full genome coverage at a high depth coverage using the Rapid SMART-9N, which takes only 10 minutes and costs up to 45% less than other methods. We found the limits of detection of these methods to be 6e00 focus forming units (FFU)/mL with 99.02% and 87.58% genome coverage for SMART-9N and Rapid SMART-9N respectively. Yellow fever virus plasma samples and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal samples previously confirmed by RT-qPCR with a broad range of Ct-values were selected for validation. Both methods produced greater genome coverage when compared to the multiplex PCR approach and we obtained the longest single read of this study (18.5 kb) with a SARS-CoV-2 clinical sample, 60% of the virus genome using the Rapid SMART-9N method. This work demonstrates that SMART-9N and Rapid SMART-9N are sensitive, low input, and long-read compatible alternatives for RNA virus detection and genome sequencing and Rapid SMART-9N improves the cost, time, and complexity of laboratory work.","2021-09-20","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-10-22 13:48:49","2024-01-05","241","","","6","","Wellcome Open Res.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A retrospective investigation was undertaken to describe clinical, epidemiological, and viral genomic features associated with deaths caused by CHIKV in Ceará state, northeast Brazil. METHODS: Sera, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue samples from 100 fatal cases with suspected arbovirus infection were tested for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Clinical, epidemiological, and death reports were obtained for patients with confirmed CHIKV infection. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent factors associated with risk of death during CHIKV infection. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using whole genomes from a subset of cases. RESULTS: Sixty-eight fatal cases had CHIKV infection confirmed by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (52.9%), viral antigen (41.1%), and/or specific immunoglobulin M (63.2%). Co-detection of CHIKV with DENV was found in 22% of fatal cases, ZIKV in 2.9%, and DENV and ZIKV in 1.5%. A total of 39 CHIKV deaths presented with neurological signs and symptoms, and CHIKV-RNA was found in the CSF of 92.3% of these patients. Fatal outcomes were associated with irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Patients with diabetes appear to die at a higher frequency during the subacute phase. Genetic analysis showed circulation of 2 CHIKV East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineages in Ceará and revealed no unique virus genomic mutation associated with fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of the largest cross-sectional cohort of CHIKV deaths to date reveals that CHIKV-ECSA strains can cause death in individuals from both risk and nonrisk groups, including young adults. © The Author(s) 2020.

We aimed to investigate whether isolates of wild-type P.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 can escape from neutralising antibodies generated by a polyclonal immune response. METHODS: We did an immunological study to assess the neutralising effects of antibodies on lineage P.1 and lineage B isolates of SARS-CoV-2, using plasma samples from patients previously infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Two specimens (P.1/28 and P.1/30) containing SARS-CoV-2 lineage P.1 (as confirmed by viral genome sequencing) were obtained from nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected from patients in Manaus, Brazil, and compared against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B (SARS.CoV2/SP02.2020) recovered from a patient in Brazil in February, 2020. Isolates were incubated with plasma samples from 21 blood donors who had previously had COVID-19 and from a total of 53 recipients of the chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine CoronaVac: 18 individuals after receipt of a single dose and an additional 20 individuals (38 in total) after receipt of two doses (collected 17-38 days after the most recent dose); and 15 individuals who received two doses during the phase 3 trial of the vaccine (collected 134-230 days after the second dose). Antibody neutralisation of P.1/28, P.1/30, and B isolates by plasma samples were compared in terms of median virus neutralisation titre (VNT50, defined as the reciprocal value of the sample dilution that showed 50% protection against cytopathic effects). FINDINGS: In terms of VNT50, plasma from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an 8·6 times lower neutralising capacity against the P.1 isolates (median VNT50 30 [IQR < 20-45] for P.1/28 and 30 [< 20-40] for P.1/30) than against the lineage B isolate (260 [160-400]), with a binominal model showing significant reductions in lineage P.1 isolates compared with the lineage B isolate (p≤0·0001). Efficient neutralisation of P.1 isolates was not seen with plasma samples collected from individuals vaccinated with a first dose of CoronaVac 20-23 days earlier (VNT50s below the limit of detection [< 20] for most plasma samples), a second dose 17-38 days earlier (median VNT50 24 [IQR < 20-25] for P.1/28 and 28 [< 20-25] for P.1/30), or a second dose 134-260 days earlier (all VNT50s below limit of detection). Median VNT50s against the lineage B isolate were 20 (IQR 20-30) after a first dose of CoronaVac 20-23 days earlier, 75 (< 20-263) after a second dose 17-38 days earlier, and 20 (< 20-30) after a second dose 134-260 days earlier. In plasma collected 17-38 days after a second dose of CoronaVac, neutralising capacity against both P.1 isolates was significantly decreased (p=0·0051 for P.1/28 and p=0·0336 for P.1/30) compared with that against the lineage B isolate. All data were corroborated by results obtained through plaque reduction neutralisation tests. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 lineage P.1 might escape neutralisation by antibodies generated in response to polyclonal stimulation against previously circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. Continuous genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 combined with antibody neutralisation assays could help to guide national immunisation programmes.

This study investigated the expression profile of cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs) after BD, and their relationship with the observed decline in myocardial function and with the changes induced by hypertonic saline solution (HSS) treatment. METHODS: Wistar rats were assigned to sham-operation (SHAM) or submitted to BD with and without the administration of HSS. Cardiac function was assessed for 6 h with left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume analysis. We screened 641 rodent miRNAs to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in the heart, and computational and functional analyses were performed to compare the differentially expressed miRNAs and find their putative targets and their related enriched canonical pathways. RESULTS: An enhanced expression in canonical pathways related to inflammation and myocardial apoptosis was observed in BD induced group, with 2 miRNAs, miR-30a-3p, and miR-467f, correlating with the level of LV dysfunction observed after BD. Conversely, HSS treated after BD and SHAM groups showed similar enriched pathways related to the maintenance of heart homeostasis regulation, in agreement with the observation that both groups did not have significant changes in LV function. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for assessing damage in BD donor hearts and to monitor the changes induced by therapeutic measures like HSS, opening a perspective to improve graft quality and to better understand the pathophysiology of BD. The possible relation of BD-induced miRNA's on early and late cardiac allograft function must be investigated. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In Brazil, the Gamma variant dominated the epidemiological scenario during the first period of 2021. Many Brazilian regions detected the Delta variant after its first description and documented its spread. To monitor the introduction and spread of VOC Delta, we performed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) genotyping and genome sequencing in ten regional sentinel units from June to October 2021 in the State of Minas Gerais (MG). We documented the introduction and spread of Delta, comprising 70 per cent of the cases 8 weeks later. Comparing the viral loads of the Gamma and Delta dominance periods, we provide additional evidence that the latter is more transmissible. The spread and dominance of Delta did not culminate in the increase in cases and deaths, suggesting that the vaccination may have restrained the epidemic growth. Analysis of 224 novel Delta genomes revealed that Rio de Janeiro state was the primary source for disseminating this variant in the state of MG. We present the establishment of Delta, providing evidence of its enhanced transmissibility and showing that this variant shift did not aggravate the epidemiological scenario in a high immunity setting. © The Author(s) 2022.

Accurate identification of the genetic variability of the virus is essential to identify lineages responsible for an epidemic and understanding the processes of virus spread and virulence. Here, we characterize, using portable nanopore genomic sequencing, different lineages of dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) detected in 22 serum samples from patients with and without dengue warning signs attended at Hospital de Base of São José do Rio Preto (SJRP) in 2019, during a DENV-2 outbreak. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data were also analyzed. The phylogenetic reconstruction and the clinical data showed that two lineages belonging to the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2-BR3 and BR4 (BR4L1 and BR4L2)-were co-circulating in SJRP. Although preliminary, these results indicate no specific association between clinical form and phylogenetic clustering at the virus consensus sequence level. Studies with larger sample sizes and which explore single nucleotide variants are needed. Therefore, we showed that portable nanopore genome sequencing could generate quick and reliable sequences for genomic surveillance to monitor viral diversity and its association with disease severity as an epidemic unfolds. © 2023.

These viruses share mosquito vector species, often infecting the same host population within overlapping geographic regions. Thus, comparative analyses of the virus evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics across spatial and temporal scales could reveal convergent trends. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Focusing on Mexico as a case study, we generated novel chikungunya and dengue (CHIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-2) virus genomes from an epidemiological surveillance-derived historical sample collection, and analysed them together with longitudinally-collected genome and epidemiological data from the Americas. Aedes-borne arboviruses endemically circulating within the country were found to be introduced multiple times from lineages predominantly sampled from the Caribbean and Central America. For CHIKV, at least thirteen introductions were inferred over a year, with six of these leading to persistent transmission chains. For both DENV-1 and DENV-2, at least seven introductions were inferred over a decade. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that CHIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-2 in Mexico share evolutionary and epidemiological trajectories. The southwest region of the country was determined to be the most likely location for viral introductions from abroad, with a subsequent spread into the Pacific coast towards the north of Mexico. Virus diffusion patterns observed across the country are likely driven by multiple factors, including mobility linked to human migration from Central towards North America. Considering Mexico's geographic positioning displaying a high human mobility across borders, our results prompt the need to better understand the role of anthropogenic factors in the transmission dynamics of Aedes-borne arboviruses, particularly linked to land-based human migration.

This study investigates the underlying mechanisms and potential treatment for 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) deleterious effects in heart failure. METHODS: Biochemical, functional, and histochemical measurements were applied to identify 4-HNE adducts in rat and human failing hearts. In vitro studies were performed to validate 4-HNE targets. RESULTS: 4-HNE, a reactive aldehyde by-product of mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure, covalently inhibits Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease essential for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. 4-HNE inhibition of Dicer impairs miRNA processing. Mechanistically, 4-HNE binds to recombinant human Dicer through an intermolecular interaction that disrupts both activity and stability of Dicer in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Dithiothreitol neutralization of 4-HNE or replacing 4-HNE-targeted residues in Dicer prevents 4-HNE inhibition of Dicer in vitro. Interestingly, end-stage human failing hearts from three different heart failure aetiologies display defective 4-HNE clearance, decreased Dicer activity, and miRNA biogenesis impairment. Notably, boosting 4-HNE clearance through pharmacological re-activation of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) using Alda-1 or its improved orally bioavailable derivative AD-9308 restores Dicer activity. ALDH2 is a major enzyme responsible for 4-HNE removal. Importantly, this response is accompanied by improved miRNA maturation and cardiac function/remodelling in a pre-clinical model of heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: 4-HNE inhibition of Dicer directly impairs miRNA biogenesis in heart failure. Strikingly, decreasing cardiac 4-HNE levels through pharmacological ALDH2 activation is sufficient to re-establish Dicer activity and miRNA biogenesis; thereby representing potential treatment for patients with heart failure. © The Author(s) 2023.

Currently, Brazil has the highest number of chikungunya cases in the Americas. We aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and recurrence pattern of chikungunya in Brazil since its introduction in 2013. METHODS: In this epidemiological study, we used CHIKV genomic sequencing data, CHIKV vector information, and aggregate clinical data on chikungunya cases from Brazil. The genomic data comprised 241 Brazilian CHIKV genome sequences from GenBank (n=180) and the 2022 CHIKV outbreak in Ceará state (n=61). The vector data (Breteau index and House index) were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health for all 184 municipalities in Ceará state and 116 municipalities in Tocantins state in 2022. Epidemiological data on laboratory-confirmed cases of chikungunya between 2013 and 2022 were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and Laboratory of Public Health of Ceará. We assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of chikungunya in Brazil via time series, mapping, age-sex distribution, cumulative case-fatality, linear correlation, logistic regression, and phylogenetic analyses. FINDINGS: Between March 3, 2013, and June 4, 2022, 253 545 laboratory-confirmed chikungunya cases were reported in 3316 (59·5%) of 5570 municipalities, mainly distributed in seven epidemic waves from 2016 to 2022. To date, Ceará in the northeast has been the most affected state, with 77 418 cases during the two largest epidemic waves in 2016 and 2017 and the third wave in 2022. From 2016 to 2022 in Ceará, the odds of being CHIKV-positive were higher in females than in males (odds ratio 0·87, 95% CI 0·85-0·89, p< 0·0001), and the cumulative case-fatality ratio was 1·3 deaths per 1000 cases. Chikungunya recurrences in the states of Ceará, Tocantins (recurrence in 2022), and Pernambuco (recurrence in 2021) were limited to municipalities with few or no previously reported cases in the previous epidemic waves. The recurrence of chikungunya in Ceará in 2022 was associated with a new East-Central-South-African lineage. Population density metrics of the main CHIKV vector in Brazil, Aedes aegypti, were not correlated spatially with locations of chikungunya recurrence in Ceará and Tocantins. INTERPRETATION: Spatial heterogeneity of CHIKV spread and population immunity might explain the recurrence pattern of chikungunya in Brazil. These results can be used to inform public health interventions to prevent future chikungunya epidemic waves in urban settings.

Here, we combined epidemiological, virological, histopathological, cytokine, molecular dynamics, metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic analyses to investigate viral and host factors that contribute to chikungunya-associated (CHIK) death. Our results indicate that CHIK deaths are associated with multi-organ infection, central nervous system damage, and elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with survivors. The histopathologic, metabolite, and proteomic signatures of CHIK deaths reveal hemodynamic disorders and dysregulated immune responses. The CHIKV East-Central-South-African lineage infecting our study population causes both fatal and survival cases. Additionally, CHIKV infection impairs the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, as evidenced by an increase in permeability and altered tight junction protein expression. Overall, our findings improve the understanding of CHIK pathophysiology and the causes of fatal infections. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This categorisation refers to S. flavonotatus, which is the pest's current valid scientific name. It is native to China and has never been recorded in the EU. It completes from 2 to 3 generations per year. Eggs are laid in cracks and crevices of trunks and branches with bark thickness of approximately 0.6–1.2 cm. The pest overwinters as an adult or as a mature larva under the bark. Plants for planting, wood with bark and wood products provide pathways for entry. Although the weevil has been reported to carry the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, it is not considered a vector. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in some EU countries would allow S. flavonotatus to establish and spread. Impact on Pinus spp. is anticipated. Recognising that the weevil is reported to attack both weakened and healthy trees, there is uncertainty on the magnitude of impact. Its recorded capacity to attack non-Asian Pinus species also indicates its ability to adapt and expand the range of trees it can utilise as hosts, which could include European Pinus species.

This species can be identified by morphological taxonomic keys and by barcoding. The adults of the overwintering generation emerge from late June to late August. The eggs are laid in groups on the underside of the host-plant leaves, on which the larvae feed throughout their six to eight larval instars. Pupation occurs in ovoid cocoons at the junction between twigs and branches, or on the trunk. Overwintering occurs as fully grown larvae or prepupae in their cocoon. There are one or two generations per year. M. flavescens is polyphagous and feeds on broadleaves; it has been reported on 51 plant species belonging to 24 families. It mainly occurs in Asia (Bhutan, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan, Nepal, the Republic of Korea), Russia (Eastern Siberia) and Taiwan. It is also present in the USA (Massachusetts). The pest's flight capacities are unknown. The main pathway for entry and spread is plants for planting with cocoons attached. This is partially closed by prohibition of some hosts. In several EU member states climatic conditions are conducive for establishment and many host plants are widespread. Introduction of M. flavescens may result in defoliations influencing tree health and forest diversity. The caterpillars also have urticating spines affecting human health. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry, establishment and spread, and there is a definite potential for classical biological control. Recognising that natural enemies prevent M. flavescens being regarded as a pest in Asia, there is uncertainty regarding the magnitude of potential impact in EU depending on the influence of natural enemies.

Recent taxonomic revision of the genus Crisisoccus concluded that C. matsumotoi is a synonym of C. seruratus; therefore, the categorisation will use the current valid name C. seruratus. It is an insect pest native to Japan, feeding on species in 13 plant families. There are reports of its presence also in China and the Republic of Korea, but there is great uncertainty about the identity of the species for these records. Therefore, there is uncertainty about the species referred to as C. matsumotoi in the commodity risk assessments of A. palmatum. C. seruratus is a multivoltine species. It has three generations per year and overwinters as a nymph. The most important crops that may be affected by C. seruratus are figs (Ficus carica), grapes (Vitis spp.), nashi pears (Pyrus pyrifolia var. culta), persimmons (Diospyros kaki) and walnuts (Juglans regia). Plants for planting and fruits provide potential pathways for entry into the EU. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that the central, northern and some areas of southern EU countries would be suitable for the establishment of C. seruratus. The introduction of this mealybug would likely have an economic impact in the EU through yield reduction and fruit downgrading because of honeydew deposition and the consequent growth of sooty moulds.

This mite is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. The eriophyid is known to occur in Africa, America, Asia, Europe (Greece and Serbia) and Oceania on Malus spp., which is the only confirmed host genus for C. baileyi. Plants for planting of Malus spp. are the main potential pathway for entry into the EU. However, plants for planting of the genus Malus Mill. are considered as high-risk plants (EU 2018/2019) and therefore prohibited from entering the EU unless granted a country-specific derogation. This is the case for the import of Malus spp. plants for planting from Serbia ((EU) 2020/1361 corrected by 2022/1309). Therefore, this derogation could provide a plausible entry pathway for C. baileyi into the EU. Climatic conditions and the ample availability of the host, Malus spp., in the EU are conducive for establishment, as proven by the occurrence of C. baileyi in Greece. However, the species is not reported as having an impact in Greece, despite reports of damage outside the EU. Measures to prevent further entry and spread of C. baileyi in the EU are available. C. baileyi satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. However, uncertainties about the distribution of C. baileyi within the EU and its impact on apples in the EU are considered key and affect the confidence of conclusions for this categorisation.","2024","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:33:23","e8804","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

This is a univoltine polyphagous pest that occurs in eastern Asia from Vietnam northwards through eastern China and Taiwan, South Korea and into Far East Russia. Hosts include species of fruit trees within the genera Malus and Prunus, trees of forestry and environmental importance such as Quercus and Ulmus, shrubs such as Wisteria, soft fruit such as Rubus, grasses, including amenity turf and field crops such as potatoes, maize and soybean. Adults feed on host leaves, tender stems, flower buds, flowers and fruits; larvae feed on host roots. In northern China P. quadriguttata is a major pest of soybean; in South Korea, P. quadriguttata is one of the most serious insect pests of golf course turf. P. quadriguttata could enter the EU on various pathways including infested soil and growing media accompanying host plants for planning. Biotic factors (host availability) and abiotic factors (climate suitability) suggest that large parts of the EU would be suitable for establishment. Local spread would be mainly via natural dispersal of adults. Long distance spread would be facilitated by the movement of eggs, larvae and pupae infesting soil especially with plants for planting; adults could spread on plants for planting without soil. Economic and or environmental impacts would be expected on a range of plants if P. quadriguttata were to establish in the EU. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of its introduction.

Most species attack apparently healthy, weakened or dead trees, either feeding on the phloem (‘bark beetles’ subgroup) or on fungi inoculated into the sapwood (‘ambrosia beetles’ subgroup). Smaller subgroups feed and reproduce in seeds and fruits, or in herbaceous plants. Some species are polygynous, the males initiate a gallery or a chamber on or in a new host and attract females. Others are monogamous, and the females initiate the new galleries. Many species respond to primary volatile attractants emitted by the hosts, and some produce aggregation pheromones that attract conspecifics of both sexes. The species attacking living hosts are often associated with fungi that contribute to weakening the host defences and provide nutrients to the insects. Some are inbreeding; the males in the offspring mate with their sisters and rarely leave their natal tree. The larvae of all species develop and pupate within their hosts. Based on catalogues and other published data, a database was constructed providing information on hosts, feeding and reproductive habits, geographic distribution and the Köppen–Geiger climate types in countries where species occur. The Scolytinae were screened to exclude species in the following categories: (i) 708 species attacking conifers; (ii) 127 species present in at least four EU Member States and (iii) 440 species occurring in areas with climatic conditions not occurring in the EU. Among the remaining 5220 species, 88 species known for their mobility, occupying at least two landmasses separated by geographical barriers and some of which had impact levels documented in literature, were extracted. They were grouped into four subcategories: (i) 12 species with high impact on plant health; (ii) 16 species with low or doubtful impact; (iii) 48 species with no impact; (iv) 12 species with no impact and which had never been recorded as ‘introduced’ in the consulted catalogues but occurring on at least two landmasses. All 88 species could enter the EU with wood or wood products, or with plants for planting, and could establish because host plants are available, and climate is suitable in parts of the EU. Control measures to inhibit introduction are available. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the potential impact of many species. Methods for the reliable identification of many species are lacking. For some species of non-EU Scolytinae on non-coniferous hosts, all criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as potential quarantine pest are met. Nevertheless, the Panel was not able to develop a method to discriminate confidently between species that clearly meet the criteria for potential quarantine pest status and those that do not.","2024","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:33:45","e8889","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

This pest categorisation was initiated following the commodity risk assessment of artificially dwarfed plants from China consisting of Pinus parviflora (Japanese white pine) grafted on P. thunbergii (Japanese black pine) performed by EFSA, in which M. matsumurae was identified as a pest of possible concern. However, its identity is not firmly established due to uncertainty regarding its taxonomic relationship with Matsucoccus pini (Green), a species widespread in Europe. M. matsumurae occurs in western China and has been reported as a pest of P. massoniana (Chinese red pine) and P. thunbergii. These hosts occur in the EU as ornamental/amenity trees. Other scales in the Matsucoccus genus feed on a variety of Pinus species and the host range of M. matsumurae could be wider than is currently recorded. The scale has one or two generations per year. All stages occur on the branches and stems of hosts with developing nymphs and adult females feeding through the bark on host phloem vessels. Symptoms include the yellowing/browning of host needles, early needle drop, desiccation of shoots and bark necrosis. The most serious infestations occur in hosts that are 8–25 years old and there can be some host mortality. In principle, host plants for planting and plant products such as cut branches and wood with bark could provide entry pathways into the EU. However, prohibitions on the import of Pinus from non-European third countries regulate these pathways. In China, M. matsumurae occurs in regions with temperate humid conditions and hot summers. These conditions are also found in parts of southern EU. Were M. matsumurae to establish in the EU, it is conceivable that it could expand its host range; however, this remains uncertain. Some uncertainty exists over the magnitude of potential impacts. M. matsumurae satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest, assuming M. pini is not a synonym, which is a key uncertainty.","2024","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:36:04","2024-10-19 09:33:35","e8970","","7","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 European Food Safety Authority.

D. indica is native to South Asian countries and is now distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. In the EU, D. indica occurs in Madeira (Portugal). It is a polyphagous pest, feeding on 16 genera in 6 plant families, primarily on plants of the Cucurbitaceae family.

The pest, which is commonly known as the pink, red or ruby wax scale, originates in Africa and is highly polyphagous attacking plants from more than 193 genera in 84 families. It has been present in Germany since 2010 in a single tropical glasshouse. It is known to attack primarily tropical and subtropical plants, but also other host plants commonly found in the EU, such as Malus sylvestris, Prunus spp., Pyrus spp. and ornamentals. It is considered an important pest of Citrus spp. The pink wax scale reproduces mainly parthenogenetically, and it has one or two generations per year. Fecundity ranges from 5 to 1178 eggs.

Unfortunately, ID cohorts often lack funding to store and share clinical-epidemiological (CE) data and high-dimensional laboratory (HDL) data long term, which is evident when the link between these data elements is not kept up to date. This becomes particularly apparent when smaller cohorts fail to successfully address the initial scientific objectives due to limited case numbers, which also limits the potential to pool these studies to monitor long-term cross-disease interactions within and across populations. CE data from 9 arbovirus (arthropod-borne viruses) cohorts in Latin America were retrospectively harmonized using the Maelstrom Research methodology and standardized to Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). We created a harmonized and standardized meta-cohort that contains CE and HDL data from 9 arbovirus studies from Latin America. To facilitate advancements in cross-population inference and reuse of cohort data, the Reconciliation of Cohort Data for Infectious Diseases (ReCoDID) Consortium harmonized and standardized CE and HDL from 9 arbovirus cohorts into 1 meta-cohort. Interested parties will be able to access data dictionaries that include information on variables across the data sets via Bio Studies. After consultation with each cohort, linked harmonized and curated human cohort data (CE and HDL) will be made accessible through the European Genome-phenome Archive platform to data users after their requests are evaluated by the ReCoDID Data Access Committee.

While many health systems underperform in treating injured patients, most assessments have not considered the whole system. We integrated findings from 9 methods using a 3 delays approach (delays in seeking, reaching, or receiving care) to prioritise important trauma care health system barriers in Karonga, Northern Malawi, and exemplify a holistic health system assessment approach applicable in comparable settings. Methods and findings To provide multiple perspectives on each conceptual delay and include data from community-based and facility-based sources, we used 9 methods to examine the injury care health system. The methods were (1) household survey; (2) verbal autopsy analysis; (3) community focus group discussions (FGDs); (4) community photovoice; (5) facility care-pathway process mapping and elucidation of barriers following injury; (6) facility healthcare worker survey; (7) facility assessment survey; (8) clinical vignettes for care process quality assessment of facility-based healthcare workers; and (9) geographic information system (GIS) analysis. Empirical data collection took place in Karonga, Northern Malawi, between July 2019 and February 2020. We used a convergent parallel study design concurrently conducting all data collection before subsequently integrating results for interpretation. For each delay, a matrix was created to juxtapose method-specific data relevant to each barrier identified as driving delays to injury care. Using a consensus approach, we graded the evidence from each method as to whether an identified barrier was important within the health system. We identified 26 barriers to access timely quality injury care evidenced by at least 3 of the 9 study methods. There were 10 barriers at delay 1, 6 at delay 2, and 10 at delay 3. We found that the barriers “cost,” “transport,” and “physical resources” had the most methods providing strong evidence they were important health system barriers within delays 1 (seeking care), 2 (reaching care), and 3 (receiving care), respectively. Facility process mapping provided evidence for the greatest number of barriers—25 of 26 within the integrated analysis. There were some barriers with notable divergent findings between the community- and facility-based methods, as well as among different community- and facility-based methods, which are discussed. The main limitation of our study is that the framework for grading evidence strength for important health system barriers across the 9 studies was done by author-derived consensus; other researchers might have created a different framework. Conclusions By integrating 9 different methods, including qualitative, quantitative, community-, patient-, and healthcare worker-derived data sources, we gained a rich insight into the functioning of this health system’s ability to provide injury care. This approach allowed more holistic appraisal of this health system’s issues by establishing convergence of evidence across the diverse methods used that the barriers of cost, transport, and physical resources were the most important health system barriers driving delays to seeking, reaching, and receiving injury care, respectively. This offers direction and confidence, over and above that derived from single methodology studies, for prioritising barriers to address through health service development and policy.","2024-01-22","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:16:57","e1004344","","1","21","","PLoS Medicine","Health system assessment for access to care after injury in low- or middle-income countries","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Health care facilities; Malawi; Autopsy; Geographic information systems; Health services research; Health systems strengthening; Low and middle income countries; Medical personnel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we mapped AMR prevalence in 7 antimicrobials in Escherichia coli and nontyphoidal Salmonella species across low- and middle-income countries (LIMCs), using 1088 point-prevalence surveys in combination with a geospatial model. Hotspots of AMR were predicted in China, India, Brazil, Chile, and part of central Asia and southeastern Africa. The highest resistance prevalence was for tetracycline (59% for E. coli and 54% for nontyphoidal Salmonella, average across LMICs) and lowest for cefotaxime (33% and 19%). We also identified the antimicrobial with the highest probability of resistance exceeding critical levels (50%) in the future (1.7–12.4 years) for each 10 × 10 km pixel on the map. In Africa and South America, 78% locations were associated with penicillins or tetracyclines crossing 50% resistance in the future. In contrast, in Asia, 77% locations were associated with penicillins or sulphonamides.

Taxation is a possible approach to incentivise appropriate antibiotic usage in food-producing animals. Taxation can be applied flatly across all antibiotic classes, targeted to single antibiotic classes, or scaled based on resistance in each class, so called “differential” taxation. However, quantifying the potential impact of taxation is challenging, due to the nonlinear and unintuitive response of AMR dynamics to interventions and changes in antibiotic usage caused by alterations in price. We combine epidemiological models with price elasticities of demand for veterinary antibiotics, to compare the potential benefits of taxation schemes with currently implemented bans on antibiotic usage. Taxation strategies had effects comparable to bans on antibiotic usage in food-producing animals to reduce average resistance prevalence and prevent increases in overall infection. Taxation could also maximise the average number of antibiotics with a resistance prevalence of under 25% and potentially generate annual global revenues of ∼1 billion US$ under a 50% taxation to current prices of food-producing animal antibiotics. Differential taxation was also able to maintain a high availability of antibiotics over time compared to single and flat taxation strategies, while also having the lowest rates of intervention failure and highest potential revenue across all taxation strategies. These findings suggest that taxation should be further explored as a tool to combat the ongoing AMR crisis.","2023-12-01","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:16:59","100650","","","17","","One Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Mathematical model; Antimicrobial resistance; One health; Food-producing animals; Intervention; Taxation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that AMR emergence is positively correlated with antibiotic consumption in humans. However, the relationship between AMR emergence and antibiotic consumption in livestock is modified by gross domestic product (GDP), with only higher GDP countries showing a slight positive association, a finding that differs from previous studies on the drivers of AMR prevalence. We also found that human travel may play a role in AMR emergence, likely driving the spread of novel AMR strains into countries where they are subsequently detected for the first time.

Many HAIs are caused by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, but there are major gaps in our understanding of the number of hospital-associated drug-resistant infections (HARIs) worldwide. As such, we estimated trends in prevalence of HARIs caused by high priority pathogens (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter spp., and Pseudomonas spp.) in 195 countries. Methods and findings Resistance prevalence estimates were extracted from 474-point prevalence surveys (PPS) from 99 countries published between 2010 and 2020 coupled with country-level estimates of hospitalization rates and length of stay. Prevalence estimates were transformed in yearly incidence of HARIs per year by country and income group. We estimate the global number of HARIs per year to be 136 million (95% credible interval (CI) 26 to 246 million) per year, with the highest burden in China (52 million, 95% CI 10 to 95 million), Pakistan (10 million, 95% CI 2 to 18 million), and India (9 million, 95% CI 3 to 15 million). Among income groups, middle-income countries bore the highest burden of HARIs per year (119 million, 95% CI 23 to 215 million). Our analysis was constrained by the limited number of PPS for HARIs, lack of community-associated data on antibiotic-resistant infections, and our population level analysis. Conclusions In this study, we observe, in the absence of systematic surveillance systems for HARIs, a baseline overview of their rates. Our yearly estimates highlight the global threat of HARIs and may help define strategies to tackle resistance in hospital settings.","2023","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:26:43","2024-10-19 09:17:14","e1004178","","6","20","","PLoS Medicine","Global incidence in hospital-associated infections resistant to antibiotics","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Antibiotics; Nosocomial infections; Hospitals; Escherichia coli; Acinetobacter infections; Antibiotic resistance; Bacterial pathogens; Klebsiella infections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), challenges in diagnosis and treatment remain, compounded by the lack of an effective vaccine. The HCV genome, characterized by high genetic variability, consists of eight distinct genotypes and over ninety subtypes, underscoring the complex dynamics of the virus within infected individuals. This study delves into the intriguing realm of HCV genetic diversity, specifically exploring the phenomenon of mixed infections and the subsequent detection of recombinant forms within the conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) region. Previous studies have identified recombination as a rare event in HCV. However, our findings challenge this notion by providing the first evidence of 1a/3a (and vice versa) inter-genotypic recombination within the conserved IRES region. Utilizing advanced sequencing methods, such as deep sequencing and molecular cloning, our study reveals mixed infections involving genotypes 1a and 3a. This comprehensive approach not only confirmed the presence of mixed infections, but also identified the existence of recombinant forms not previously seen in the IRES region. The recombinant sequences, although present as low-frequency variants, open new avenues for understanding HCV evolution and adaptation.","2024-04","2024-10-19 08:40:19","2024-10-19 08:40:19","2024-10-19 08:39:35","560","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","","NGS; HCV; inter-genotypic recombination; IRES; mixed infections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among viruses causing meningitis, Toscana virus (TOSV), a phlebovirus, is transmitted through sandfly bites. TOSV infection may be suspected if patients with enterovirus- and herpesvirus-negative aseptic (non-bacterial) meningitis recall recent insect bites. Other epidemiological factors (season, rural area) may be considered. The broad range of possible meningitis aetiologies poses considerable diagnosis challenges. Untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can potentially identify pathogens, which are not considered or detected in routine diagnostic panels. Aim In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, we investigated mNGS usefulness to understand the cause of meningitis when conventional approaches fail. Methods Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients hospitalised in southern Spain in 2015–2019 with aseptic meningitis and no aetiology found by conventional testing, were subjected to mNGS. Patients’ demographic characteristics had been recorded and physicians had asked them about recent insect bites. Obtained viral genome sequences were phylogenetically analysed. Results Among 23 idiopathic cases, TOSV was identified in eight (all male; median age: 39 years, range: 15–78 years). Five cases lived in an urban setting, three occurred in autumn and only one recalled insect bites. Phylogenetic analysis of TOSV segment sequences supported one intra-genotype reassortment event. Conclusions Our study highlights the usefulness of mNGS for identifying viral pathogens directly in CSF. In southern Spain, TOSV should be considered regardless of recalling of insect bites or other epidemiological criteria. Detection of a disease-associated reassortant TOSV emphasises the importance of monitoring the spread and evolution of phleboviruses in Mediterranean countries.","2023-11-09","2024-10-19 08:40:19","2024-10-19 08:40:19","2024-10-19 08:39:25","2200913","","45","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.eurosurveillance.org","","Publisher: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Power supply from these sources can be adapted to perfectly match the timing of power requirements of demand systems. The energy transition largely consists in substituting renewable power—which is intermittent by nature—to controllable sources, leading to disconnection between instantaneous power production and demand. Energy storage is a potential solution for balancing production and demand and safeguarding the operating conditions of the demand system. In this paper we quantify the effects of renewable power supply (solar and wind) on the operation of a standard poultry farm. We model the balance of power generation and demand considering the growth conditions of poultry and local weather data including temperatures, wind speed and solar radiation. We assess scenarios of renewable power supply in function of the size of the power plant, the wind-to-solar power generation mix and energy storage, and assess the impact of power supply patterns on the operating intensity (productivity) of the demand system. We show that, with a limited storage capacity, it is possible to achieve non-negligible shares of renewable power penetration without major loss in farm productivity. However, a full transition to renewable power would require the combination of i)-large energy storage compared to the annual demand, ii)- significant oversizing of the power production plant, and iii)-the exclusion of power generation combinations (wind/solar) that deviate from the timing of demand. Storage and power plant oversizing is all the more critical as production and demand are uncorrelated over the year. The ratio of useful to unused energy storage by the end of the year varies with the energy mix and operating intensity (productivity) of the farm. We discuss the implications of different energy configurations on the performance of the demand system.","2023-10-02","2024-10-19 08:38:44","2024-10-19 08:38:44","2024-10-19 08:36:56","e0286242","","10","18","","PLOS ONE","Variable renewable energy penetration impact on productivity","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Wind; Poultry; Livestock; Alternative energy; Photovoltaic power; Power grids; Tin; Wind power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure that we characterize the underlying ecological processes and implement appropriate conservation measures, it is important to consider multiple dimensions of diversity. Here, we use a rare dataset of bee communities spanning over 100 years (1910–2019) in northern France, an area subject to severe land use alteration. By analyzing species-level data together with functional traits, we demonstrate a significant decline and homogenization of taxonomic diversity associated with a functional restructuring of bee communities. By combining extinction probabilities based on Red List categories with functional characteristics, we identified species critical for maintaining functional diversity and in need of urgent conservation actions. Present-day communities exhibited functional shifts favoring larger, eusocial generalist species with a long phenology, likely reflecting greater adaptability to reduced resource availability in space and time. Species with higher thermal resistance and warmer climatic niches were favored over time, indicating functional filtering of species adapted to climatic warming. In addition, recent bee communities were characterized by species with larger habitat breadth and stronger affinity for artificial habitats. These changes resulted in decreased functional evenness and increased dominance of species with extreme trait combinations, reducing functional redundancy and potentially destabilizing ecosystem processes. Suitable habitats and host plants are identified and recommended for supporting the most functionally threatened bee species.

BVD aetiological agents are three pestiviruses (BVDV-1, -2 and HoBi-like pestivirus), which exhibit high genetic diversity and complex transmission cycles. This considerably hampers the management of the disease, which is why eradication plans have been implemented in several countries. In France, a national plan has been in place since 2019. Our understanding of its impact on the distribution of BVDV genotypes is limited by the availability of French genetic data. Here, we conducted a molecular epidemiology study to refine our knowledge of BVDV genetic diversity in France, characterise its international relationships, and analyse national spatio-temporal genotypic distribution. We collated 1037 BVDV-positive samples throughout France between 2011 and 2023, with a greater sampling effort in two major cattle production areas. We developed a high-throughput sequencing protocol which we used to complete the 5’UTR genotyping of this collection. We show that two main BVDV-1 genotypes, 1e and 1b, account for 88% of genotyped sequences. We also identified seven other BVDV-1 genotypes occurring at low frequencies and three BVDV-2 samples (genotype 2c). Phylogenetic analyses indicate different worldwide distribution patterns between the two main BVDV-1 genotypes. Their relative frequencies present no major changes in France since the 1990s and few variations at the national scale. We also found some degree of local spatial structuring in western France. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of large-scale sequence-based surveillance to monitor changes in the epidemiological situation of enzootic diseases.","2024-10-03","2025-01-20 14:15:16","2025-01-20 14:18:05","2025-01-07 09:20:29","129","","1","55","","Vet.

Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses of proteins captured from petal microsomes of two Asteraceae species (Rudbeckia hirta and Tagetes erecta) revealed the presence of two flavonol 6-hydroxylases and several additional not fully characterized proteins as candidates for the identification of novel flavonol 8-hydroxylases, as well as relevant flavonol methyl- and glycosyltransferases.

Here, we investigated the impact of Ca2+ in regulating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell fate in response to the anti-cancer agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We observed that ATRA promotes calcium entry through store-operated calcium (SOC) channels into acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. This response is associated with changes in the expression profiles of ORAI1 and STIM1, two proteins involved in SOC channels activation, as well as with a significant upregulation of several key proteins associated to calcium signaling. Moreover, ATRA treatment of APL cells led to a significant activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) and its downstream effector AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), linking Ca2+ signaling to autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of SOC channels and CAMKK2 enhanced ATRA-induced cell differentiation and death. Altogether, our results unravel an ATRA-elicited signaling pathway that involves SOC channels/CAMKK2 activation, induction of autophagy, inhibition of cellular differentiation and suppression of cell death. We suggest that SOC channels and CAMKK2 may constitute novel drug targets for potentiating the anti-cancer effect of ATRA in APL patients.","2021-11-30","2025-01-20 14:15:16","2025-01-20 14:16:02","2025-01-20 12:27:40","3364","","12","10","","Cells","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled twenty-one OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis, and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches, we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes-Oléron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.","2022-01-01","2025-01-31 08:08:39","2025-01-31 08:09:31","2022-07-07","veac039","","1","8","","Vir.

This can bring crucial information to stakeholders for disease management. Unfortunately, aquatic virus genomes are usually difficult to characterize because most of these viruses cannot be easily propagated in vitro. Developing methodologies for routine genome sequencing of aquatic viruses is timely given the ongoing threat of disease emergence. This is particularly true for pathogenic viruses infecting species of commercial interest that are widely exchanged between production basins or countries. For example, the ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1­ ) is a Herpesvirus widely associated with mass mortality events of juvenile Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Genomes of Herpesviruses are large and complex with long direct and inverted terminal repeats. In addition, OsHV-­1 is unculturable. It therefore accumulates several features that make its genome sequencing and assembly challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a tangential flow filtration (TFF) method to enrich OsHV-1­ infective particles from infected host tissues. This virus purification allowed us to extract high molecular weight and high-­quality viral DNA that was subjected to Illumina short-­read and Nanopore long-­read sequencing. Dedicated bioinformatic pipelines were developed to assemble complete OsHV-1­ genomes with reads from both sequencing technologies. Nanopore sequencing allowed characterization of new structural variations and major viral isomers while having 99,98 % of nucleotide identity with the Illumina assembled genome. Our study shows that TFF-b­ ased purification method, coupled with Nanopore sequencing, is a promising approach to enable in field sequencing of unculturable aquatic DNA virus.","2022-11-10","2025-01-31 08:08:39","2025-01-31 08:08:39","2022-12-01","","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for pathogens with low per-site mutation rates, such as DNA viruses, that do not exhibit a large amount of evolutionary change among genetic sequences sampled at different time points. However, whole-genome sequencing can reveal the accumulation of novel genetic variation between samples, promising to render most, if not all, microbial pathogens measurably evolving and suitable for analytical techniques derived from population genetic theory. Here, we aim to assess the measurability of evolution on epidemiological time scales of the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), a double stranded DNA virus of which a new variant, OsHV-1 μVar, emerged in France in 2008, spreading across Europe and causing dramatic economic and ecological damage. We performed phylogenetic analyses of heterochronous ( n = 21) OsHV-1 genomes sampled worldwide. Results show sufficient temporal signal in the viral sequences to proceed with phylogenetic molecular clock analyses and they indicate that the genetic diversity seen in these OsHV-1 isolates has arisen within the past three decades. OsHV-1 samples from France and New Zealand did not cluster together suggesting a spatial structuration of the viral populations. The genome-wide study of simple and complex polymorphisms shows that specific genomic regions are deleted in several isolates or accumulate a high number of substitutions. These contrasting and non-random patterns of polymorphism suggest that some genomic regions are affected by strong selective pressures. Interestingly, we also found variant genotypes within all infected individuals. Altogether, these results provide baseline evidence that whole genome sequencing could be used to study population dynamic processes of OsHV-1, and more broadly herpesviruses.","2021-07-13","2025-01-31 08:08:39","2025-01-31 08:09:22","2022-12-01 15:25:15","711377","","","12","","Front.

Autophagy is an important degradation pathway involved in the response to several pathologies including viral diseases. In <italic>C. gigas</italic>, recent studies indicate that this pathway is conserved and functional in at least haemocytes and the mantle. Furthermore, an experimental infection in combination with compounds known to inhibit or induce autophagy in mammals revealed that autophagy is involved in the response to OsHV-1 infection. In light of these results, the aim of this study was to determine the role of autophagy in the response of the Pacific oyster to infection by virus OsHV-1. For this purpose, an experimental infection in combination with a modulator of autophagy was performed on Pacific oysters known to have intermediate susceptibility to OsHV-1 infection. In haemolymph and the mantle, the autophagy response was monitored by flow cytometry, western blotting, and real-time PCR. At the same time, viral infection was evaluated by quantifying viral DNA and RNA amounts by real-time PCR. Although the results showed activation of autophagy in haemolymph and the mantle 14 hours post infection (after viral replication was initiated), they were also indicative of different regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in the two tissues, thus supporting an important function of autophagy in the response to virus OsHV-1. </p>","2022-04-04","2025-01-31 08:08:39","2025-01-31 08:10:00","2025-01-22 15:37:38","","","","12","","Front.

Due to the complex genomic architecture and the presence of multiple genomic isomers, short-read sequencing using Illumina method struggles to accurately assemble tandem and repeat regions and to identify and characterize large structural variations in the OsHV-1 genome. Third-generation sequencing technologies, as long-read real-time nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), offer new possibilities for OsHV-1 whole-genome analysis. Identification of the best method for extraction of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA and development of accurate bioinformatic pipelines for its characterization are now required. To this end, we evaluated and compared six HMW methods and one conventional DNA extraction kit for their ability to extract OsHV-1 DNA from M. gigas -infected tissues. We then evaluated the ability of ONT sequencing to produce an accurate OsHV-1 genome from both whole-genome and “adaptive sampling” (AS) sequencing approaches. Finally, we evaluated the efficiency of bioinformatics tools for de novo assembly and consensus calling to generate accurate OsHV-1 genomes. The HMW DNA extraction kit coupled with ONT sequencing and dedicated bioinformatics tools allowed us to produce accurate OsHV-1 genomes compared to those assembled using Illumina technology. The AS approach allowed up to 60% enrichment for viral data, and the long reads generated by ONT allowed the characterization of OsHV-1 isomers. Together with its portability, this sequencing shows great promise as a diagnostic tool for the characterization of unculturable aquatic viruses directly from host tissues. IMPORTANCE Many aquatic viruses threaten commercially valuable species and cause significant economic losses during outbreaks. To improve our understanding of the origin, transmission patterns and spread of these viruses, additional genomic data are essential. However, genomic characterization of unculturable large DNA viruses is a major challenge.
