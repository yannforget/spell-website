We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This diversity is unevenly distributed across the species range, delimiting genetic diversity hotspots (GDH). Focusing conservation efforts on regions where GDH of several species overlap (i.e., multispecies GDH) could rationalize conservation efforts by protecting several taxa in one go. However, recent studies suggest the existence of many species-specific GDH. This would make spatially prioritizing protection even more challenging as it requires the integration of these multiple GDH rather than few hotspots into conservation planning. Here, we characterize GDH of nine co-distributed bee species through an original comparative mapping approach to assess the suitability of a spatial prioritization strategy to protect their genetic diversity. Location We studied bee populations from Europe. Methods First, we used a sliding window approach to estimate the nucleotide diversity and its geographic distribution to highlight GDH of each species. Second, we assessed the overlap of GDH between species by generating consensus maps based on the species-specific maps of nucleotide diversity. Third, we used the GDH distribution patterns to identify the extent of cost-effective area network that would be needed to protect genetic diversity of all nine species. Results Genetic diversity was unevenly distributed across species ranges, but we found no evidence of a large overlap among GDH from all species. Cost-effective area network needed to protect genetic diversity of all species spreads over several large geographic areas including regions under high human development pressures. Main conclusions Genetic diversity hotspots' location is species-specific. Therefore, focusing conservation efforts strictly on the few regions harbouring GDH for many bee species is unlikely to be sufficient to ensure long-term persistence of all species. Conservation actions should be implemented simultaneously in different regions according to a complementary-based conservation approach, to optimize the conservation of all bee diversity.","2018","2019-09-09 18:38:50","2021-06-29 08:43:31","","1860-1868","","12","24","","","Divergent geographic patterns of genetic diversity among wild bees","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endemic pathogens that infect an individual in the ﬁrst years of life, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating or ameliorating morbidity and mortality. Pathogen associations are ubiquitous but poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. We report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found signiﬁcant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identiﬁed both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens.

This study tests the potential teratogenic effects of Wēnzhōu infection on the development of a Murid rodent, Rattus exulans. Using direct virus detection, morphological records and comparative analyses, a link was demonstrated between host infection status and host morphologies (the spleen irrespective of weight, the skull shape and the cranial cavity volume) at the level of the individual (females only). This study demonstrates that mammarenavirus infections can impact natural host physiology and/or affect developmental processes. The presence of an infecting micro-parasite during the development of the rat may lead to a physiological trade-off between immunity and brain size. Alternatively, replication of virus in specialized organs can result in selective morphologic abnormalities and lesions.","2017-05","2018-03-20 10:48:40","2018-03-20 10:48:41","2018-03-20 10:48:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.","2017-10-11","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2021-06-29 08:30:15","2018-11-07 13:34:07","20170919","","1864","284","","Proc.

This study integrated parasitological and ancient DNA methods with a large sample set dating between Neolithic and Early Modern periods to explore the utility of molecular archaeoparasitology as a new approach to study the past. Molecular analyses provided unequivocal species-level parasite identification and revealed location-specific epidemiological signatures. Faecal–oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were ubiquitous across time and space. By contrast, high numbers of food-associated cestodes (Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata) were restricted to medieval Lübeck. The presence of these cestodes and changes in their prevalence at approximately 1300 CE indicate substantial alterations in diet or parasite availability. Trichuris trichiura ITS-1 sequences grouped into two clades; one ubiquitous and one restricted to medieval Lübeck and Bristol. The high sequence diversity of T.t.ITS-1 detected in Lübeck is consistent with its importance as a Hanseatic trading centre. Collectively, these results introduce molecular archaeoparasitology as an artefact-independent source of historical evidence.","2018","2018-10-06 18:36:13","2018-10-06 18:36:13","","","","1888","285","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The found relationships led us to pursue a third goal: (3) use temporal dynamics in woody cover to estimate potential woody cover. Location Sub-Saharan African savannas. Methods The study used very high spatial resolution satellite imagery at sites with overlapping older (2002–2006) and newer (2011–2016) imagery to estimate change in woody cover. We sampled 596 sites in 38 separate areas across African savannas. Areas with high anthropogenic impact were avoided in order to more clearly identify the influence of environmental factors. Relationships between woody cover change and potential drivers were identified using linear regression and simultaneous autoregression, where the latter accounts for spatial autocorrelation. Results The mean annual change in woody cover across our study areas was 0.25% per year. Although we cannot explain the general trend of encroachment based on our data, we found that change rates were positively correlated with the difference between potential woody cover and actual woody cover (a proxy for water availability; p < .001), and negatively correlated with fire frequency (p < .01). Using the relationship between rates of encroachment and initial cover, we estimated potential woody cover at different rainfall levels. Main conclusions The results indicate that woody encroachment is ongoing and widespread across African savannas. The fact that the difference between potential and actual cover was the most significant predictor highlights the central role of water availability and tree–tree competition in controlling change in woody populations, both in water-limited and mesic savannas. Our approach to derive potential woody cover from the woody cover change trajectories demonstrates that temporal dynamics in woody populations can be used to infer resource limitations.","2018","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","1209-1218","","6","45","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors.

We anticipate that woody canopy cover, crown density, crown size, and the level of spatial aggregation among woody plants in the landscape will vary across environmental gradients. A high level of woody plant aggregation is most distinct in periodic vegetation patterns (PVPs), which emerge as a result of ecohydrological processes such as runoff generation and increased infiltration close to plants. Similar, albeit weaker, forces may influence the spatial distribution of woody plants elsewhere in savannas. Exploring these trends can extend our knowledge of how semi-arid vegetation structure is constrained by rainfall regime, soil type, topography, and disturbance processes such as fire. Using high-spatial-resolution imagery, a flexible classification framework, and a crown delineation method, we extracted woody vegetation properties from 876 sites spread over African savannas. At each site, we estimated woody cover, mean crown size, crown density, and the degree of aggregation among woody plants. This enabled us to elucidate the effects of rainfall regimes (MAP and seasonality), soil texture, slope, and fire frequency on woody vegetation properties. We found that previously documented increases in woody cover with rainfall is more consistently a result of increasing crown size than increasing density of woody plants. Along a gradient of mean annual precipitation from the driest (&lt;<span class=""thinspace""></span>200<span class=""thinspace""></span>mm<span class=""thinspace""></span>yr<sup>−1</sup>) to the wettest (1200–1400<span class=""thinspace""></span>mm<span class=""thinspace""></span>yr<sup>−1</sup>) end, mean estimates of crown size, crown density, and woody cover increased by 233, 73, and 491<span class=""thinspace""></span>% respectively. We also found a unimodal relationship between mean crown size and sand content suggesting that maximal savanna tree sizes do not occur in either coarse sands or heavy clays. When examining the occurrence of PVPs, we found that the same factors that contribute to the formation of PVPs also correlate with higher levels of woody plant aggregation elsewhere in savannas and that rainfall seasonality plays a key role for the underlying processes.</p>","2017-07-10","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","3239-3252","","13","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.biogeosciences.net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiological agents are spirochete bacteria that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.) complex and are transmitted by hard ticks among a large range of vertebrate hosts. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector. In the absence of a vaccine and given the current difficulties to diagnose and treat chronic Lyme syndromes, there is urgent need for prevention. In this context, accurate information on the spatial patterns of risk of exposure to ticks is of prime importance for public health. The objective of our study was to provide a snapshot map of the risk of human infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. pathogens in a periurban forest at a high resolution, and to analyze the factors that contribute to variation in this risk. Field monitoring took place over three weeks in May 2011 in the suburban Sénart forest (3,200ha; southeast of Paris), which receives over 3 million people annually. We sampled ticks over the entire forest area (from 220 forest stands with a total area of 35,200m(2)) and quantified the density of questing nymphs (DON), the prevalence of infection among nymphs (NIP), and the density of infected nymphs (DIN), which is the most important predictor of the human risk of Lyme borreliosis. For each of these response variables, we explored the relative roles of weather (saturation deficit), hosts (abundance indices of ungulates and Tamias sibiricus, an introduced rodent species), vegetation and forest cover, superficial soil composition, and the distance to forest roads. In total, 19,546 questing nymphs were collected and the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. was tested in 3,903 nymphs by qPCR. The mean DON was 5.6 nymphs per 10m(2) (standard deviation=10.4) with an average NIP of 10.1% (standard deviation=0.11). The highest DIN was 8.9 infected nymphs per 10m(2), with a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation=0.6). Our mapping and modeling revealed a strong heterogeneity of risk within the forest. The highest risk was found in the eastern part of the forest and localized patches in the northwestern part. Lyme borreliosis risk was positively associated with stands of deciduous trees (mainly oaks) and roe deer abundance. Contrary to expectations, DIN actually increased with distance from the point of introduction of T. sibiricus (i.e., DIN was higher in areas with potentially lower abundances of T. sibiricus). Thus, despite the fact that T. sibiricus is an important reservoir host for B. burgdorferi s. l., our study found that other explanatory factors played a more important role in determining the density of infected ticks. Precise mapping of the risk of exposure to Lyme borreliosis in a highly visited forest represents an important tool for targeting prevention and control measures, as well as making the general public and local health officials aware of the risks.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:19","2019-01-16 13:40:19","","644-652","","5","7","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26897396","","","","","Animals; Humans; Population Density; Ixodes ricinus; Forests; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Acarological risk map; Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Paris; Risk Assessment; Sciuridae; Tick density; Tick infection prevalence; Ticks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disentangling transmission patterns in such systems is often challenging, yet investigating how different host species contribute to transmission is crucial to properly assess and manage disease risk. We aim to reveal transmission cycles of bacteria within the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, which include Lyme disease agents. We characterized Borrelia genotypes found in 488 infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs collected in the Sénart Forest located near Paris (France). These genotypes were compared to those observed in three sympatric species of small mammals and network analyses reveal four independent transmission cycles. Statistical modelling shows that two cycles involving chipmunks, an introduced species, and non-sampled host species such as birds, are responsible for the majority of tick infections. In contrast, the cycle involving native bank voles only accounts for a small proportion of infected ticks. Genotypes associated with the two primary transmission cycles were isolated from Lyme disease patients, confirming the epidemiological threat posed by these strains. Our work demonstrates that combining high-throughput sequence typing with networks tools and statistical modeling is a promising approach for characterizing transmission cycles of multi-host pathogens in complex ecological settings.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:06","2019-01-16 13:40:06","","31273","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27498685 PMCID: PMC4976386","","","","","Phylogeny; Animals; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Humans; Zoonoses; Ecology; Forests; Birds; Disease Reservoirs; Genotype; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; France; Introduced Species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features make the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex an attractive biological model that can be used to study the diversification and the epidemiology of endemic bacterial pathogens. We investigated the potential of population genomic approaches to study these processes. Sixty-three strains belonging to three species within the Borrelia burgdorferi complex were isolated from questing ticks in Alsace (France), a region where Lyme disease is highly endemic. We first aimed to characterize the degree of genetic isolation among the species sampled. Phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses revealed clear delineations: there was a ∼50 fold difference between intra-specific and inter-specific recombination rates. We then investigated whether the population genomic data contained information of epidemiological relevance. In phylogenies inferred using most of the genome, conspecific strains did not cluster in clades. These results raise questions about the relevance of different strategies when investigating pathogen epidemiology. For instance, here, both classical analytic approaches and phylodynamic simulations suggested that population sizes and migration rates were higher in B. garinii populations, which are normally associated with birds, than in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations. The phylogenetic analyses of the infection-related ospC gene and its flanking region provided additional support for this finding. Traces of recombination among the B. burgdorferi s.s. lineages and lineages associated with small mammals were found, suggesting that they shared the same hosts. Altogether, these results provide baseline evidence that can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the host range of B. burgdorferi lineages based on population genomic data.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:51","2021-07-02 11:20:48","","e94384","","4","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24721934 PMCID: PMC3993988","","","","","Phylogeny; Genetic Variation; Animals; Humans; Host Specificity; Birds; Mammals; Disease Vectors; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Lyme Disease; Ticks; France; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Genome, Bacterial; Metagenomics; Reproductive Isolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an epidemiological perspective, it is important to determine whether genetic variants within the species complex are able to spread freely through the whole host community or, instead, if certain variants are restricted to particular hosts. To this end, we characterized the genotypes of members of the B. burgdorferi species complex; the bacteria were isolated from more than two hundred individuals captured in the wild and belonging to three different rodent host species. For each individual, we used a high-throughput approach to amplify and sequence rplB, a housekeeping gene, and ospC, which is involved in infection. This approach allowed us to evaluate the genetic diversity both within and among species in the B. burgdorferi species complex. Strong evidence of genetic differentiation among host species was revealed by both genes, even though they are, a priori, not constrained by the same selective pressures. These data are discussed in the context of the advancements made possible by multi-locus high-throughput sequencing and current knowledge of Lyme disease epidemiology.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:30","2021-07-02 11:20:42","","e88581","","2","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24533116 PMCID: PMC3922933","","","","","Phylogeny; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Genetic Variation; Algorithms; Animals; Host Specificity; Sequence Alignment; Mice; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Genotype; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; Antigens, Bacterial; Arvicolinae; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we apply both phylodynamic and phylogenetic community ecology techniques to examine the consequences of pathogen heterogeneity on transmission by assessing subtype-specific transmission pathways in a social carnivore. We use comprehensive social and spatial network data to examine transmission pathways for three subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle ) in African lions (Panthera leo) at multiple scales in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used FIVPle molecular data to examine the role of social organization and lion density in shaping transmission pathways and tested to what extent vertical (i.e., father- and/or mother-offspring relationships) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) transmission underpinned these patterns for each subtype. Using the same data, we constructed subtype-specific FIVPle co-occurrence networks and assessed what combination of social networks, spatial networks or co-infection best structured the FIVPle network. While social organization (i.e., pride) was an important component of FIVPle transmission pathways at all scales, we find that FIVPle subtypes exhibited different transmission pathways at within- and between-pride scales. A combination of social and spatial networks, coupled with consideration of subtype co-infection, was likely to be important for FIVPle transmission for the two major subtypes, but the relative contribution of each factor was strongly subtype-specific. Our study provides evidence that pathogen heterogeneity is important in understanding pathogen transmission, which could have consequences for how endemic pathogens are managed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community phylogenetic ecology coupled with phylodynamic techniques can reveal insights into the differential evolutionary pressures acting on virus subtypes, which can manifest into landscape-level effects.","2017","2019-01-16 13:38:25","2019-01-16 13:38:25","","1469-1482","","6","86","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28884827","","","","","Phylogeny; Animals; community ecology; Coinfection; feline immunodeficiency virus; generalized dissimilarity modelling; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; landscape ecology; Lentivirus Infections; Lions; OTU networks; phylogenetic diversity; Social Behavior; social systems; Tanzania; transmission mode; wildlife disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four spatially explicit local scenarios are built each including a narrative, two future land cover maps up to 2040 and 2100, and a set of quantified LULCC. Scenarios are then used to identify areas likely to encounter land cover changes (deforestation, reforestation, and encroachment) prone to affect gravitational hazards. In order to demonstrate their interest for decision-making, future land cover maps are used as input to a landslide hazard assessment model.

Triatomine sampling was performed in two municipalities of Casanare, Colombia, specifically in the intersection of riparian forests and oil palm plantations. For R. prolixus abundance per palm, the predictors showing more relationship were palm species and blood meal species identified in the palm, and for T. cruzi infection per triatomine, they were palm species and nymphal stage. Palm microclimate was very similar in both palm species and did not show a relationship with triatomine abundance. Comparing palm species, A. butyracea showed more blood meal species, including more refractory host species, than E. guineensis, but lower T. cruzi infection rate and parasitaemia. Interestingly, non-arboreal blood meal species were frequently found in the analyzed nymphs, indicating that the blood source for R. prolixus in palms corresponded to all the fauna located in the surrounded landscape and not only in the palm.

The model considers susceptible and infected vector and host populations. When comparing the proportion of vectors infected with T. cruzi predicted by the model with empirical data, we found a trend of increasing vector infection as anthropogenic landscape disturbance increases for both data and model output. The model's vector infection rates were significantly lower than empirical results, but when incorporating host congenital transmission in the model, vector infection approaches field data.

The parasite is transmitted by triatomine insects, of which some species are often associated with palms. The establishment of oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis) in the Orinoco region (Colombia) has been rapidly growing, possibly constituting a new environment for the establishment and increase in triatomine populations. In this study, the potential of Rhodnius prolixus to colonize E. guineensis plantations and maintain T. cruzi transmission was assessed. Fieldwork was conducted in two areas located in the department of Casanare for sampling E. guineensis and Attalea butyracea palms, sampling for triatomines to determine their abundance and prevalence of T. cruzi infection. To assess T. cruzi transmission potential in the area, sylvatic and domestic mammals were sampled. Results showed that palm infestation with triatomines was higher in A. butyracea than in E. guineensis palms and T. cruzi infection in triatomines varied between habitats for one study area, but was constant in the other site. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mammals in the E. guineensis plantations were mainly generalist rodents, suggesting that these mammals could have an important role in T. cruzi transmission in plantations. In conclusion, E. guineensis plantations in the Orinoco region are suitable habitats for R. prolixus and T. cruzi transmission.","2020-07","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-07-02 11:18:08","","428-436","","1","103","","Am.

Nonetheless, identifying routes of disease transmission within a population, and determining the key groups of individuals that drive parasite transmission and maintenance, are fundamental to understanding disease dynamics. Gammaherpesviruses are a widespread group of DNA viruses that infect many vertebrate species, and murine gammaherpesviruses (i.e. MuHV-4) are a standard lab model for studying human herpesviruses, for which much about the pathology and immune response elicited to infection is well understood. However, despite this extensive research effort, primarily in the lab, the transmission route of murine gammaherpesviruses within their natural host populations is not well understood. Here, we aimed to understand wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV) transmission, by fitting a series of population dynamic models to field data on wood mice naturally infected with WMHV and then estimating transmission parameters within and between demographic groups of the host population. Different models accounted for different combinations of host sex (male/female), age (subadult/adult) and transmission functions (density/frequency-dependent). We found that a density-dependent transmission model incorporating explicit sex groups fitted the data better than all other proposed models. Male-to-male transmission was the highest among all possible combinations of between- and within-sex transmission classes, suggesting that male behaviour is a key factor driving WMHV transmission. Our models also suggest that transmission between sexes, although important, wasn’t symmetrical, with infected males playing a significant role in infecting naïve females but not vice versa. Overall this work shows the power of coupling population dynamic models with long-term field data to elucidate otherwise unobservable transmission processes in wild disease systems.","2021-06-01","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:13:19","100451","","","35","","Epidemics","Who acquires infection from whom?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Disease ecology; Disease transmission; Host classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many factors have contributed to shifts in the disease distribution and eco epidemiological outcomes, resulting in the emergence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreaks and the incrimination of vectors in unreported regions. New research development is vital for establishing the new paradigms of the present transmission cycles, hoping to facilitate new control strategies to reduce parasite transmission. Hereafter, this work aims to model and infer the current transmission cycles of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia defined by vector and mammal species distributed and interacting in the different regions and validate them by performing sand fly and mammal collections. Vector-host co-occurrences were computed considering five ecoregions of the Colombian territory defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and downloaded from The Nature Conservancy TNC Maps website. Four validation sites were selected based on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis prevalence reports. Sand flies and mammals captured in the field were processed, and species were defined using conventional taxonomic guidelines. Detection of infection by Leishmania was performed to identify transmission cycles in the selected areas. This study uses predictive models based on available information from international gazetteers and fieldwork to confirm sand fly and mammalian species' sustaining Leishmania transmission cycles. Our results show an uneven distribution of mammal samples in Colombia, possibly due to sampling bias, since only two departments contributed 50% of the available samples. Bats were the vertebrates with the highest score values, suggesting substantial spatial overlap with sand flies than the rest of the vertebrates evaluated. Fieldwork allowed identifying three circulating Leishmania species, isolated from three sand fly species. In the Montane Forest ecosystem, one small marsupial, Gracilinanus marica, was found infected with Leishmania panamensis, constituting the first record of this species infected with Leishmania. In the same locality, an infected sand fly, Pintomyia pia, was found. The overall results could support the understanding of the current transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Colombia.","2021-03-24","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:14:17","6789","","1","11","","Sci.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the population densities and relative abundance of triatomines and mammals that may be involved in the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease to clarify the epidemiological scenario in an endemic area in the province of Casanare. Insect vectors on Attalea butyracea palms were captured using both manual searches and bait traps. The capture of mammals was performed using Sherman and Tomahawk traps. We report an infestation index of 88.5% in 148 palms and an index of T. cruzi natural infection of 60.2% in 269 dissected insects and 11.9% in 160 captured mammals. High population densities of triatomines were observed in the sylvatic environment and there was a high relative abundance of reservoirs in the area, suggesting a stable enzootic cycle. We found no evidence of insect domiciliation.

While DVGs have been described for most viruses, identifying which, if any, can be used as therapeutic agents remains a challenge. We present a combined experimental evolution and computational approach to triage DVG sequence space and pinpoint the fittest deletions, using Zika virus as an arbovirus model. This approach identifies fit DVGs that optimally interfere with wild-type virus infection. We show that the most fit DVGs conserve the open reading frame to maintain the translation of the remaining non-structural proteins, a characteristic that is fundamental across the flavivirus genus. Finally, we demonstrate that the high fitness DVG is antiviral in vivo both in the mammalian host and the mosquito vector, reducing transmission in the latter by up to 90%. Our approach establishes the method to interrogate the DVG fitness landscape, and enables the systematic identification of DVGs that show promise as human therapeutics and vector control strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission and disease.","2021-04-16","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:12:56","2290","","1","12","","Nat.

Based on the detailed trade matrices from FAO covering the period from 1986 to 2013, we present an analysis of the world cereal trade in terms of weighted and directed networks. The network nodes are the countries and the links are the trades of agricultural products in mass. We reveal the changing topology and degree distribution of the world network during the studied period. We distinguish three entangled subnetwork structures when considering the temporal stability of the trades. The three subnetworks display distinct properties and a differential contribution in total trade. Trades of uninterrupted activity over the 28-year study period compose the backbone network which accounts for two thirds of all traded mass and is scale-free. Inversely, two thirds of the trades only have one or two consecutive years of activity and define the transient subnetwork which displays random growth and accounts for very little traded mass. The trades of intermediate duration display an exponential growth both in numbers and in traded mass and define the intermediate subnetwork. The topology of each subnetwork is a time invariant. The identification of invariant structures is a useful basis for developing prospective agri-food network modelling to assess their resilience to perturbations and shocks.","2019","2021-09-27 13:36:55","2021-09-27 13:36:55","2021-09-27 13:36:12","e0216318","","5","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Europe; Network analysis; Centrality; Clustering coefficients; Exponential functions; Food; Geopolitics; Scale-free networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viral evolutionary studies frequently adopt an uncorrelated clock model as a generic relaxed molecular clock process, but this may impose considerable estimation bias if discrete rate variation exists among clades or lineages. For HIV-1 group M, rate variation among subtypes has been shown to result in inconsistencies in time to the most recent common ancestor estimation. Although this calls into question the adequacy of available molecular dating methods, no solution to this problem has been offered so far. Here, we investigate the use of mixed effects molecular clock models, which combine both fixed and random effects in the evolutionary rate, to estimate divergence times. Using simulation, we demonstrate that this model outperforms existing molecular clock models in a Bayesian framework for estimating time-measured phylogenies in the presence of mixed sources of rate variation, while also maintaining good performance in simpler scenarios. By analysing a comprehensive HIV-1 group M complete genome data set we confirm considerable rate variation among subtypes that is not adequately modelled by uncorrelated relaxed clock models. The mixed effects clock model can accommodate this rate variation and results in a time to the most recent common ancestor of HIV-1 group M of 1920 (1915–25), which is only slightly earlier than the uncorrelated relaxed clock estimate for the same data set. The use of complete genome data appears to have a more profound impact than the molecular clock model because it reduces the credible intervals by 50 per cent relative to similar estimates based on short envelope gene sequences.","2019-07-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:24:48","","","2","5","","","Divergence dating using mixed effects clock modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021). Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein (L18F, ΔH69/V70, S898F, ΔY144, S162G, A222V, N439K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A and D1118H) that confer higher transmissibility and/or antibody escape (immune evasion) upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom (UK), although many other regions/countries were identified (southeastern Asia, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the USA, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Pakistan). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries, resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island.","2021-06-09","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1098","","6","13","","Viruses","A Comprehensive Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34207490 PMCID: PMC8227210","","","","","Genome, Viral; Phylogeny; Mutation; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Phylogeography; molecular epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Communicable Disease Control; RNA, Viral; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19; Cyprus; Nasopharynx","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assay consists of three partially overlapping PCRs followed by Sanger population or Illumina next-generation sequencing. Seventy-seven therapy-naïve samples, spanning the entire diversity range of currently known HCV1b, were used for optimization of PCRs, of which ten were sequenced using Sanger and of these ten, four using Illumina. The median detection limits for the three regions, 5'UTR-NS2, E2-NS5A and NS4B-NS5B, were 570, 5670 and 56,670 IU/ml respectively. The number of Illumina reads mapped varied according to the software used, Segminator II being the best performing (81%). Consensus Illumina and Sanger sequencing results accord largely (0.013% major discordances). Differences were due almost exclusively to a larger number of ambiguities (presumably minority variants) scored by Illumina (1.50% minor discordances). The assay is easy to perform in an equipped laboratory; nevertheless, it was difficult to reach high sensitivity and reproducibility, due to the high genetic viral variability. This assay proved to be suitable for detecting drug resistance mutations and can also be used for epidemiological research, even though only a limited set of samples was used for validation.","2014-12","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","126-135","","","209","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25245140","","","","","Sequence Analysis, DNA; Humans; Illumina; NGS; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Antiviral Agents; Sensitivity and Specificity; Reproducibility of Results; Genotyping; Drug resistance; Drug Resistance, Viral; Full-genome sequencing; Genotyping Techniques; HCV1b; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Microbial Sensitivity Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A second objective of this study was to analyze associations between vaccine-specific immune responses and epitope mutation rates. DESIGN: HIV-1-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were subjected to immunotherapy by the administration of an autologous dendritic cell-based therapeutic vaccine expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef and subsequent ATI. METHODS: HIV-1 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA obtained before initiation of cART as well as during ATI. Control sequences for virus evolution in untreated HIV-1-infected individuals were obtained from the HIV Sequence Database (Los Alamos). CD8 T-cell epitope regions were defined based on literature data and prediction models. HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated to analyze their impact on sequence evolution. RESULTS: Viral sequence evolution in the tat, rev, and nef genes of vaccinated patients was similar to that of controls. The number of mutations observed inside and outside CD8 T-cell epitopes was comparable for vaccine-targeted and nontargeted proteins. We found no evidence for an impact of vaccine-induced or enhanced immune responses on the number of mutations inside or outside epitopes.

Little is known about the safety of ATI and its long-term impact on patient health. OBJECTIVES: ATI safety was assessed and potential biomarkers predicting viral rebound were evaluated. METHODS: PBMCs, plasma and CSF were collected from 11 HIV-1-positive individuals at four different timepoints during ATI (NCT02641756). Total and integrated HIV-1 DNA, cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 RNA transcripts and restriction factor (RF) expression were measured by PCR-based assays. Markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury [neurofilament light chain (NFL) and YKL-40 protein] were measured in CSF. Additionally, neopterin, tryptophan and kynurenine were measured, both in plasma and CSF, as markers of immune activation. RESULTS: Total HIV-1 DNA, integrated HIV-1 DNA and CA viral RNA transcripts did not differ pre- and post-ATI. Similarly, no significant NFL or YKL-40 increases in CSF were observed between baseline and viral rebound. Furthermore, markers of immune activation did not increase during ATI. Interestingly, the RFs SLFN11 and APOBEC3G increased after ATI before viral rebound. Similarly, Tat-Rev transcripts were increased preceding viral rebound after interruption. CONCLUSIONS: ATI did not increase viral reservoir size and it did not reveal signs of increased neuronal injury or inflammation, suggesting that these well-monitored ATIs are safe. Elevation of Tat-Rev transcription and induced expression of the RFs SLFN11 and APOBEC3G after ATI, prior to viral rebound, indicates that these factors could be used as potential biomarkers predicting viral rebound.","2020-05-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1311-1320","","5","75","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32053203 PMCID: PMC7869780","","","","","Humans; HIV-1; RNA, Viral; HIV Infections; APOBEC-3G Deaminase; Biomarkers; Nuclear Proteins; Viral Load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have mainly focused on the capital cities of Brazilian federal states, and the fact that HIV-1C infections increase at a higher rate than subtype B infections in Brazil calls for a better understanding of the process of spatial spread. A comprehensive sequence data set sampled across 22 Brazilian locations was assembled and analyzed. A Bayesian phylogeographic generalized linear model approach was used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of HIV-1C in Brazil, considering several potential explanatory predictors of the viral diffusion process. Analyses were performed on several subsampled data sets in order to mitigate potential sample biases. We reveal a central role for the city of Porto Alegre, the capital of the southernmost state, in the Brazilian HIV-1C epidemic (HIV-1C_BR), and the northward expansion of HIV-1C_BR could be linked to source populations with higher HIV-1 burdens and larger proportions of HIV-1C infections. The results presented here bring new insights to the continuing discussion about the HIV-1C epidemic in Brazil and raise an alternative hypothesis for its spatiotemporal history. The current work also highlights how sampling bias can confound phylogeographic analyses and demonstrates the importance of incorporating external information to protect against this. IMPORTANCE: Subtype C is responsible for the largest HIV infection burden worldwide, but our understanding of its transmission dynamics remains incomplete. Brazil witnessed a relatively recent introduction of HIV-1C compared to HIV-1B, but it swiftly spread throughout the south, where it now circulates as the dominant variant. The northward spread has been comparatively slow, and HIV-1B still prevails in that region. While epidemiological data and viral genetic analyses have both independently shed light on the dynamics of spread in isolation, their combination has not yet been explored. Here, we complement publically available sequences and new genetic data from 13 cities with epidemiological data to reconstruct the history of HIV-1C spread in Brazil. The combined approach results in more robust reconstructions and can protect against sampling bias. We found evidence for an alternative view of the HIV-1C spatiotemporal history in Brazil that, contrary to previous explanations, integrates seamlessly with other observational data.","2015-12","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","12341-12348","","24","89","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26423943 PMCID: PMC4665240","","","","","Phylogeny; Humans; Phylogeography; Female; HIV-1; Male; HIV Infections; Brazil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice.

Of these antigenically distinct viruses, the H3N2 virus was consistently detected in substantial proportions in Korea during the 2010/11-2013/14 seasons when compared to the other viruses and appeared responsible for the influenza-like illness rate peak during the first half of the 2011/12 season. To further scrutinize possible causes for this, we investigated the evolutionary and serological relationships between the vaccine and Korean H3N2 strains during the 2011/12 season for the main antigenic determinants of influenza viruses, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. In the 2011/12 season, when the number of H3N2 cases peaked, the majority of the Korean strains did not belong to the HA clade of A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine, and no Korean strains were of this lineage in the NA segment. In a serological assay, post-vaccinated human sera exhibited much reduced hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against the non-vaccine clade Korean H3N2 strains. Moreover, Korean strains harbored several amino acid differences in the HA antigenic sites and in the NA with respect to vaccine lineages during this season. Of these, the HA antigenic site C residues 45 and 261 and the NA residue 81 appeared to be the signatures of positive selection. In subsequent seasons, when H3N2 cases were lower, the HA and NA genes of vaccine and Korean strains were more phylogenetically related to each other. Combined, our results provide indirect support for using phylogenetic clustering patterns of the HA and possibly also the NA genes in the selection of vaccine viruses and the assessment of vaccine effectiveness.","2017-03-03","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:55:19","e0172059","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Phylogenetics; Influenza; Evolutionary genetics; Influenza viruses; Viral evolution; Antigens; Hemagglutination inhibition test; Viral vaccines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly susceptible AG129 mice were used to allow for a maximal/unlimited expansion of the viral populations. Infected mice uniformly developed neurotropic disease; the virus was isolated from their brains, plaque purified and sequenced. Viral RNA populations were overall rather homogenous [Shannon entropies 0-0.15]. The remaining, yet limited intra-host population diversity (0-11 nucleotide exchanges per genome) appeared to be a consequence of pre-existing clonal heterogeneities (quasispecies) of Stamaril®. In parallel, mice were infected with a molecular clone of YFV-17D which was in vivo launched from a plasmid. Such plasmid-launched YFV-17D had a further reduced and almost clonal evolution. The limited intra-host evolution during unrestricted expansion in a highly susceptible host is relevant for vaccine and drug development against flaviviruses in general. Firstly, a propensity for limited evolution even upon infection with a (very) low inoculum suggests that fractional dosing as implemented in current YF-outbreak control may pose only a limited risk of reversion to pathogenic vaccine-derived virus variants. Secondly, it also largely lowers the chance of antigenic drift and development of resistance to antivirals.","2019","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","1734-1746","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31797751 PMCID: PMC6896426","","","","","Genetic Variation; Animals; Plasmids; Evolution, Molecular; Mice; Brain; Antibodies, Viral; Yellow fever virus; Disease Models, Animal; fractional dosing; intra-host evolution; live-attenuated vaccine; virus diversity; Yellow Fever; Yellow Fever Vaccine; YFV-17D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A better understanding of the geographical and temporal dynamics of RSV circulation will assist in tracking resistance against therapeutics currently under development. Since 2015, the field of RSV molecular epidemiology has evolved rapidly with around 20-30 published articles per year. The objective of this systematic review is to identify knowledge gaps in recent RSV genetic literature to guide global molecular epidemiology research. We included 78 studies published between 2015 and 2020 describing 12,998 RSV sequences of which 8,233 (63%) have been uploaded to GenBank. Seventeen (22%) studies were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and seven (9%) studies sequenced whole-genomes. Although most reported polymorphisms for monoclonal antibodies in clinical development (nirsevimab, MK-1654) have not been tested for resistance in neutralisation essays, known resistance was detected at low levels for the nirsevimab and palivizumab binding site. High resistance was found for the suptavumab binding site. We present the first literature review of an enormous amount of RSV genetic data. The need for global monitoring of RSV molecular epidemiology becomes increasingly important in evaluating the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody candidates as they reach their final stages of clinical development. We have identified the following three knowledge gaps: whole-genome data to study global RSV evolution, data from LMICs and data from global surveillance programs.","2021-09-20","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","e2284","","","","","","A systematic review on global RSV genetic data","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34543489","","","","","molecular epidemiology; monoclonal antibodies; respiratory syncytial virus; RSV; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Spain, ongoing transmission of HCV is mostly fuelled by people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with subtype 1a (HCV1a). Aim Our aim was to map how infections spread within and between populations, which could help formulate more effective intervention programmes to halt the HCV1a epidemic in Spain. Methods Epidemiological links between HCV1a viruses from a convenience sample of 283 patients in Spain, mostly PWID, collected between 2014 and 2016, and 1,317, 1,291 and 1,009 samples collected abroad between 1989 and 2016 were reconstructed using sequences covering the NS3, NS5A and NS5B genes. To efficiently do so, fast maximum likelihood-based tree estimation was coupled to a flexible Bayesian discrete phylogeographic inference method. Results The transmission network structure of the Spanish HCV1a epidemic was shaped by continuous seeding of HCV1a into Spain, almost exclusively from North America and European countries. The latter became increasingly relevant and have dominated in recent times. Export from Spain to other countries in Europe was also strongly supported, although Spain was a net sink for European HCV1a lineages. Spatial reconstructions showed that the epidemic in Spain is diffuse, without large, dominant within-country networks. Conclusion To boost the effectiveness of local intervention efforts, concerted supra-national strategies to control HCV1a transmission are needed, with a strong focus on the most important drivers of ongoing transmission, i.e. PWID and other high-risk populations.","2019-02-28","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:09:31","1800227","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.eurosurveillance.org","","Publisher: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequences obtained from drug resistance testing were used for subtyping, TDR determination and transmission clusters (TC) analyses. Results In Portugal, transmission of subtype B was significantly associated with young males, while transmission of subtype G was associated with older heterosexuals. In Portuguese originated people, there was a decreasing trend both for prevalence of subtype G and for number of TCs in this subtype. The active TCs that were identified (i.e. clusters originated after 2008) were associated with subtype B-infected males residing in Lisbon. TDR was significantly different when comparing subtypes B (10.8% [9.5–12.2]) and G (7.6% [6.4–9.0]) (p = 0.001).

Here, we report potential evasion strategies of influenza A viruses under in vivo passive anti-M2e IgG immune selection pressure in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. A/Puerto Rico/8/34-infected SCID mice were treated with the M2e-specific mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MAb 65 (IgG2a) or MAb 37 (IgG1), which recognize amino acids 5 to 15 in M2e, or with MAb 148 (IgG1), which binds to the invariant N terminus of M2e. Treatment of challenged SCID mice with any of these MAbs significantly prolonged survival compared to isotype control IgG treatment. Furthermore, M2e-specific IgG2a protected significantly better than IgG1, and even resulted in virus clearance in some of the SCID mice. Deep sequencing analysis of viral RNA isolated at different time points after treatment revealed that the sequence variation in M2e was limited to P10H/L and/or I11T in anti-M2e MAb-treated mice. Remarkably, in half of the samples isolated from moribund MAb 37-treated mice and in all MAb 148-treated mice, virus was isolated with a wild-type M2 sequence but with nonsynonymous mutations in the polymerases and/or the hemagglutinin genes. Some of these mutations were associated with delayed M2 and other viral gene expression and with increased resistance to anti-M2e MAb treatment of SCID mice. Treatment with M2e-specific MAbs thus selects for viruses with limited variation in M2e. Importantly, influenza A viruses may also undergo an alternative escape route by acquiring mutations that result in delayed wild-type M2 expression. IMPORTANCE Broadly protective influenza vaccine candidates may have a higher barrier to immune evasion compared to conventional influenza vaccines. We used Illumina MiSeq deep sequence analysis to study the mutational patterns in A/Puerto Rico/8/34 viruses that evolve in chronically infected SCID mice that were treated with different M2e-specific MAbs. We show that under these circumstances, viruses emerged in vivo with mutations in M2e that were limited to positions 10 and 11. Moreover, we discovered an alternative route for anti-M2e antibody immune escape, in which a virus is selected with wild-type M2e but with mutations in other gene segments that result in delayed M2 and other viral protein expression. Delayed expression of the viral antigen that is targeted by a protective antibody thus represents an influenza virus immune escape mechanism that does not involve epitope alterations.","2021-08-31","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","e0074521","","4","12","","mBio","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34253060 PMCID: PMC8406285","","","","","influenza; deep sequencing; broadly protective; escape; immunotherapy; monoclonal antibodies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Available patient metadata were qualitatively interpreted and correlated with onwards transmission using Fisher exact tests and logistic regression. Most infections were from subtypes A (n=36), B (n=815) and C (n=211). Africa is the dominant origin location for subtypes A and C while the subtype B epidemic was seeded from the USA and Middle America and, from the early 1990s onwards, mostly by interprovincial spread. Subtypes A (77.8%) and C (74.0%) were usually heterosexually transmitted and circulate predominantly among Blacks (61.1% and 85% respectively). Subtype B was mostly found among Caucasians (48.6%) and First Nations (36.8%), and its modes of transmission were stratified by ethnic origin. Compared to subtypes A (5.6%) and C (3.8–10.0%), a larger portion of subtype B patients were found within putative provincial transmission networks (20.3–29.5%), and this almost doubled when focusing on nationwide transmission clusters (37.9–57.5%).

The variation in inoculum size among different risk groups therefore implies that the adaptation rate of HIV may vary between epidemics with different risk group compositions. Furthermore, factors that govern the rate of within-host evolution may also vary by risk group and therefore contribute to evolutionary differences at the epidemic level. Methods We adopted a population genetic approach to test whether the different proportions of multi-variant transmissions are reflected by varying proportions of transmitted diversity between men-having-sex-with-men (MSM), heterosexual (HET) and direct blood contact (BC) sub-populations. To this purpose, we collected all available transmission chain clonal sequence data sets (n = 70) available at the Los Alamos HIV website and through an extensive literature search. To assess evolutionary rate differences among different risk groups, we compiled risk group datasets for several subtypes and directly compared the absolute substitution rate and its synonymous and non-synonymous components. Results There was sufficient demographic signal to inform the transmission model in BEAST using env data to compare the transmission bottleneck size between the MSM and HET risk groups, i.e. the largest contributors to HIV spread. We find no indications for a different proportion of transmitted genetic diversity at the population level between these groups. In the direct rate comparisons between risk groups, however, we consistently recover a higher evolutionary rate in the male dominated risk group compared to the HET datasets. Conclusions We find that the risk group composition impacts the viral evolutionary rate and therefore potentially also the adaptation rate. In particular, risk group-specific sex ratios, and the variation in within-host evolutionary rates between males and females, imposes evolutionary rate differences at the epidemic level, but we cannot exclude a role of varying transmission rates.","2015-07-31","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:43:10","1549-1556","","12","29","","AIDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26244394 PMCID: PMC5348249","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent commercialization of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about the possibility of characterizing complex viral populations at previously unattainable scales. An important consideration in designing experiments with these technologies is the need for large quantities of input DNA. To accommodate low-input samples, an amplification step is required, usually a PCR, which comes at the risk of introducing a bias that potentially distorts the view of the viral population composition. By implementing a new sample preprocessing protocol, Willerth et al. address these experimental limitations in the context of complete HIV genome sequencing.

Measures of phylogenetic signal are widely used in ecological and evolutionary research, and are recently gaining traction in viral evolutionary studies. Standard estimators of phylogenetic signal frequently condition on data summary statistics of the repeated trait observations and fixed phylogenetics trees, resulting in information loss and potential bias. To incorporate the observation process and phylogenetic uncertainty in a model-based approach, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to simultaneously estimate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic signal from molecular sequence data and repeated multivariate traits. Our approach builds upon a phylogenetic diffusion framework that model continuous trait evolution as a Brownian motion process and incorporates Pagel's λ transformation parameter to estimate dependence among traits. We provide a computationally efficient inference implementation in the BEAST software package. We evaluate the synthetic performance of the Bayesian estimator of phylogenetic signal against standard estimators, and demonstrate the use of our coherent framework to address several virus-host evolutionary questions, including virulence heritability for HIV, antigenic evolution in influenza and HIV, and Drosophila sensitivity to sigma virus infection. Finally, we discuss model extensions that will make useful contributions to our flexible framework for simultaneously studying sequence and trait evolution.","2015-01-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","67-82","","1","6","","","Simultaneously estimating evolutionary history and repeated traits phylogenetic signal","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25780554 PMCID: PMC4358766","","","","","adaptation; Bayesian phylogenetics; virulence; comparative approach; virus evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of comprehensive direct comparative analyses of the evolutionary processes at different biological scales, our understanding of how fast within-host HIV-1 evolutionary rates translate to lower rates at the between host level remains incomplete. Here, we address this by analyzing pol and env data from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain for which both the timing and the direction is known for most transmission events. To this purpose, we develop a new transmission model in a Bayesian genealogical inference framework and demonstrate how to constrain the viral evolutionary history to be compatible with the transmission history while simultaneously inferring the within-host evolutionary and population dynamics. We show that accommodating a transmission bottleneck affords the best fit our data, but the sparse within-host HIV-1 sampling prevents accurate quantification of the concomitant loss in genetic diversity. We draw inference under the transmission model to estimate HIV-1 evolutionary rates among epidemiologically-related patients and demonstrate that they lie in between fast intra-host rates and lower rates among epidemiologically unrelated individuals infected with HIV subtype C. Using a new molecular clock approach, we quantify and find support for a lower evolutionary rate along branches that accommodate a transmission event or branches that represent the entire backbone of transmitted lineages in our transmission history. Finally, we recover the rate differences at the different biological scales for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, which is only compatible with the ‘store and retrieve’ hypothesis positing that viruses stored early in latently infected cells preferentially transmit or establish new infections upon reactivation.","2014","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:41:15","e1003505","","4","10","","","The Genealogical Population Dynamics of HIV-1 in a Large Transmission Chain","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Phylogenetics; Phylogenetic analysis; HIV; HIV-1; HIV epidemiology; Viral evolution; Evolutionary immunology; Evolutionary rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lin et al. (2015, Journal of Virology, 89/7: 3512–22) recently investigated the evolutionary history of hepatitis B virus in a transmission chain and postulated that the ‘colonization–adaptation–transmission’ model can explain the differential impact of transmission on synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates. Here, we revisit this dataset using a full probabilistic Bayesian phylogenetic framework that adequately accounts for the non-independence of sequence data when estimating evolutionary parameters. Examination of the transmission chain data under a flexible coalescent prior reveals a general inconsistency between the estimated timings and clustering patterns and the known transmission history, highlighting the need to incorporate host transmission information in the analysis. Using an explicit genealogical transmission chain model, we find strong support for a transmission-associated decrease of the overall evolutionary rate. However, in contrast to the initially reported larger transmission effect on non-synonymous substitution rate, we find a similar decrease in both non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates that cannot be adequately explained by the colonization-adaptation-transmission model. An alternative explanation may involve a transmission/establishment advantage of hepatitis B virus variants that have accumulated fewer within-host substitutions, perhaps by spending more time in the covalently closed circular DNA state between each round of viral replication. More generally, this study illustrates that ignoring phylogenetic relationships can lead to misleading evolutionary estimates.","2017-07-01","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 13:59:46","","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Massively parallelized ""mechanical cloning"" and sequencing technologies were quickly adopted by HIV researchers in order to broaden the understanding of the clinical importance of minor drug-resistant variants. These efforts have, however, remained largely limited to small genomic regions. The growing need to monitor multiple genome regions for drug resistance testing, as well as the obvious benefit for studying evolutionary and epidemic processes makes complete genome sequencing an important goal in viral research. In addition, a major drawback for NGS applications to RNA viruses is the need for large quantities of input DNA. Here, we use a generic overlapping amplicon-based near full-genome amplification protocol to compare low-input enzymatic fragmentation (Nextera™) with conventional mechanical shearing for Roche 454 sequencing. We find that the fragmentation method has only a modest impact on the characterization of the population composition and that for reliable results, the variation introduced at all steps of the procedure--from nucleic acid extraction to sequencing--should be taken into account, a finding that is also relevant for NGS technologies that are now more commonly used. Furthermore, by applying our protocol to deep sequence a number of pre-therapy plasma and PBMC samples, we illustrate the potential benefits of a near complete genome sequencing approach in routine genotyping.","2016-01-07","2021-09-27 14:43:34","2021-09-27 14:43:34","","E12","","1","8","","Viruses","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26751471 PMCID: PMC4728572","","","","","Genome, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; HIV; HIV-1; NGS; HIV Infections; Sequence Analysis, RNA; full genome sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early diagnosis and timely treatment influences the outcome of dengue illness, as delay in care-seeking is significantly associated with complications leading to severe dengue. We aimed to understand patterns of health seeking behaviour (HSB) in individuals exposed to high dengue incidence in order to improve early attendance to health centres. Methods Between September 2013 and February 2014 a cross-sectional household survey was performed in Maracay, Venezuela. Intended HSB of adults and children’s parents/guardians was assessed with respect to fever or suspected dengue. Data was collected through structured questionnaires from 105 individuals. Results Most individuals felt at risk of dengue and believed it could be a deadly disease. In the case of suspected dengue, the majority (60%) would choose to first seek medical help versus first treating at home, in contrast to 11% in the case of fever. Amongst those who decided to visit a doctor, a suspected dengue infection would prompt them to search medical help earlier than if having only fever (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis modelling showed that the independent factors associated with the intention to firstly visit a doctor versus treating at home in the case of dengue were feeling at risk (OR = 3.29; p = 0.042) and being an adult (as opposed to caring for a child as a parent/guardian; OR = 3.33, p = 0.021), while having had a previous dengue infection (OR = 0.29; p = 0.031) and living in the neighbourhood Caña de Azúcar (OR = 0.28, p = 0.038) were negatively associated with seeking medical care as their first action. Conclusion Knowledge of HSB related to dengue is scarce in the Americas, our study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of HSB in this region. Improving early dengue disease recognition and awareness may enhance prompt attendance to medical care in affected populations and thereby reduce mortality and severity of dengue. Especially for those with a previous dengue infection, efforts have to be made to promote prompt health centre attendance.","2015","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:38:27","2022-01-04 10:08:35","e0004237","","12","9","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","Health Seeking Behaviour and Treatment Intentions of Dengue and Fever","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","Medical risk factors; Behavioral and social aspects of health; Caregivers; Dengue fever; Fevers; Pediatrics; Physicians; Venezuela","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, to stratify dengue prevalence in space may be an efficacious strategy to target surveillance and control efforts in a cost-effective manner particularly in Venezuela where dengue is hyperendemic and public health resources are scarce. Here, we determine hot spots of dengue seroprevalence and the risk factors associated with these clusters using local spatial statistics and a regression modeling approach. Methodology/Principal Findings From August 2010 to January 2011, a community-based cross-sectional study of 2012 individuals in 840 households was performed in high incidence neighborhoods of a dengue hyperendemic city in Venezuela. Local spatial statistics conducted at household- and block-level identified clusters of recent dengue seroprevalence (39 hot spot households and 9 hot spot blocks) in all neighborhoods. However, no clusters were found for past dengue seroprevalence. Clustering of infection was detected at a very small scale (20-110m) suggesting a high disease focal aggregation. Factors associated with living in a hot spot household were occupation (being a domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.002), lower socio-economic status (living in a shack (P<0.001), sharing a household with <7 people (P = 0.004), promoting potential vector breeding sites (storing water in containers (P = 0.024), having litter outdoors (P = 0.002) and mosquito preventive measures (such as using repellent, P = 0.011). Similarly, low socio-economic status (living in crowded conditions, P<0.001), having an occupation of domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.012) and not using certain preventive measures against mosquitoes (P<0.05) were directly associated with living in a hot spot block. Conclusions/Significance Our findings contribute to a better comprehension of the spatial dynamics of dengue by assessing the relationship between disease clusters and their risk factors. These results can inform health authorities in the design of surveillance and control activities.

However, 57% of the examined houses had potential Aedes breeding sites indoors and/or outdoors, most of which positive for Aedes spp. larvae/pupae. Preventive practices were associated with a previous dengue infection (P = 0.030) and a better knowledge on dengue symptoms and transmission route (P = 0.020).

In Venezuela, dengue has emerged as one of the most important public health problems of urban areas with frequent epidemics since 2001. The long-term pattern of this disease has involved not only a general upward trend in cases but also a dramatic increase in the size and frequency of epidemic outbreaks. By assuming that climate variability has a relevant influence on these changes in time, we quantified the periodicity of dengue incidence in time-series of data from two northern regions of Venezuela. Disease cycles of 1 and 3–4 years (p < 0.05) were detected. We determined that dengue cycles corresponded with local climate and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation at both seasonal and inter-annual scales (every 2–3 years). Dengue incidence peaks were more prevalent during the warmer and dryer years of El Niño confirming that ENSO is a regional climatic driver of such long-term periodicity through local changes in temperature and rainfall.

This study aimed to optimize the use of shotgun metagenomics and subsequent bioinformatics analysis to detect and type DENV directly from clinical samples without targeted amplification. Additionally, presence of DENV quasispecies (intra-host variation) was revealed by detecting single nucleotide variants. Viral RNA was isolated with or without DNase-I treatment from 17 DENV ([1], [2], [3], [4]) positive blood samples. cDNA libraries were generated using either a combination of the NEBNext® RNA to synthesize cDNA followed by Nextera XT DNA library preparation, or the TruSeq RNA V2 (TS) library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced using both the MiSeq and NextSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed complete ORFs for all samples by all approaches, but longer contigs and higher sequencing depths were obtained with the TS kit. No differences were observed between MiSeq and NextSeq sequencing. Detection of multiple DENV serotypes in a single sample was feasible. Finally, results were obtained within three days with associated reagents costs between €130−170/sample. Therefore, shotgun metagenomics is suitable for identification and typing of DENV in a clinical setting.","2019-01-01","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:39:16","2022-01-04 10:10:00","100009","","","306","","","","Articles initially published in Journal of Biotechnology: X: 1-4, 2019","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Dengue; Molecular epidemiology; Arboviruses; Next-generation sequencing; Shotgun metagenomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in low- and middle-income countries, eHealth could potentially offer cost-effective solutions to bridge financial, social, time, and distance challenges. Objective: The goal of the research is to understand what would make eHealth globally applicable and gain insight into different TB situations, opportunities, and challenges. Methods: We performed focus group interviews with TB experts and patients from 6 different countries on 4 different continents. The focus group interviews followed the theory of planned behavior framework to offer structured recommendations for a versatile eHealth solution. The focus group interviews were preceded by a general demographic and technology use questionnaire. Questionnaire results were analyzed using basic statistics in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Focus group interview data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti 8 (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH) by assigning codes to quotations and grouping codes into the 5 domains within the framework. Results: A total of 29 patients and 32 medical staff members were included in our study. All medical staff had used the internet, whereas 31% (9/61) of patients had never been online. The codes with the most quotations were information in relation to eHealth (144 quotations) and communication (67 quotations). The consensus among all participants from all countries is that there are important communication and information gaps that could be bridged by an eHealth app. Participants from different countries also highlighted different challenges, such as a majority of asylum-seeker patients or lack of infrastructure that could be addressed with an eHealth app. Conclusions: Within the 6 countries interviewed, there is high enthusiasm toward eHealth in TB. A potential app could first target information and communication gaps in TB, with additional modules aimed at setting-specific challenges.","2020-11-02","2022-01-04 10:20:34","2022-01-04 10:39:44","2022-01-04 10:11:24","e18156","","11","8","","","Patients and Medical Staff Attitudes Toward the Future Inclusion of eHealth in Tuberculosis Management","","","","","","","EN","Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

Historically, malaria incidence in southern Venezuela has accounted for most of the country's total number of cases. The efficient deployment of disease prevention measures and prediction of disease spread to new regions requires an in-depth understanding of spatial heterogeneity on malaria transmission dynamics. Herein, we characterized the spatial epidemiology of malaria in southern Venezuela from 2007 through 2017 and described the extent to which malaria distribution has changed country-wide over the recent years. We found that disease transmission was focal and more prevalent in the southeast region of southern Venezuela where two persistent hotspots of Plasmodium vivax (76%) and P. falciparum (18%) accounted for ~60% of the total number of cases. Such hotspots are linked to deforestation as a consequence of illegal gold mining activities. Incidence has increased nearly tenfold over the last decade, showing an explosive epidemic growth due to a significant lack of disease control programs. Our findings highlight the importance of spatially oriented interventions to contain the ongoing malaria epidemic in Venezuela.

Here, we describe the spatial epidemiology of COVID-19 in Venezuela and its relation to the population mobility, migration patterns, non-pharmaceutical interventions and fuel availability that impact population movement. Using a metapopulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, we explore how movement patterns could have driven the observed distribution of cases. Low within-country connectivity most likely delayed the onset of the epidemic in most states, except for those bordering Colombia and Brazil, where high immigration seeded outbreaks.

Serum free thiols (R-SH, sulfhydryl groups) comprise a robust marker of systemic oxidative stress, since they are readily oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, serum free thiol concentrations were measured in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls and their associations with relevant clinical parameters were examined. Serum free thiol concentrations were measured colorimetrically (Ellman&rsquo;s method) in 29 non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects and 30 age-, sex-, and body-mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls and analyzed for associations with clinical and biochemical disease parameters. Additional free thiol measurements were performed on seven serum samples from COVID-19 subjects who required hospitalization to examine their correlation with disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 had significantly lower concentrations of serum free thiols compared to healthy controls (p = 0.014), indicating oxidative stress. Serum free thiols were positively associated with albumin (St. &beta; = 0.710, p &lt; 0.001) and inversely associated with CRP (St. &beta; = &minus;0.434, p = 0.027), and showed significant discriminative ability to differentiate subjects with COVID-19 from healthy controls (AUC = 0.69, p = 0.011), which was slightly higher than the discriminative performance of CRP concentrations regarding COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.042). This study concludes that systemic oxidative stress is increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls.

Following production patterns, network properties and added-value chains, exportable surpluses of countries can offset food and feed deficits in other countries. However, production and trade patterns are barely addressed in the scientific literature as two interactive components of global agriculture. Integrated analysis of the temporal dynamics and distribution patterns of production and trade among countries can help addressing future food security challenges in view of ongoing trends. Here, we analyse the interdependent patterns of global agricultural production and trade from 1986 to 2016. We classify total production and trade mass into six product categories—cereals, oilcrops, meat, fruits and vegetables, coffee and cocoa. We estimate reexports in global trade by assessing mass balances of production, imports and exports per country. We show that global trade and reexports increase exponentially faster than production and that production and trade are highly centralized among a small number of countries. For most agricultural categories, the centralization of flows has increased in time for production and net exports, and has decreased for net imports and reexports. Accordingly, a growing number of deficient countries are sustained by a decreasing number of top-producing countries. In parallel, reexport routes are increasingly dominated by long-industrialized countries besides the increase in time in the number of reexporting countries. We discuss the interdependencies between global agricultural production and trade patterns. We highlight the drivers and implications of the observed trends for food security challenges.","2022-02","2022-07-07 09:56:34","2022-07-07 09:56:34","2022-07-07 09:55:31","034022","","3","17","","Environ.

The impact of these additional resources on infectious diseases can manifest through different pathways, affecting host susceptibility, contact rate and host demography. To date however, empirical research has tended to examine these different pathways in isolation, for example by quantifying the effects of provisioning on host behaviour in the wild or changes in immune responses in controlled laboratory studies. Furthermore, while theory has investigated the interactions between these pathways, this work has focussed on a narrow subset of pathogen types, typically directly transmitted microparasites. Given the diverse ways that provisioning can affect host susceptibility, contact patterns or host demography, we may expect the epidemiological consequences of provisioning to vary among different parasite types, dependent on key aspects of parasite life history, such as the duration of infection and transmission mode. Focusing on an exemplar empirical system, the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, and its diverse parasite community, we developed a suite of epidemiological models to compare how resource provisioning alters responses for a range of these parasites that vary in their biology (microparasite and macroparasite), transmission mode (direct, environmental and vector transmitted) and duration of infection (acute, latent and chronic) within the same host population. We show there are common epidemiological responses to host resource provisioning across all parasite types examined. In particular, the epidemiological impact of provisioning could be driven in opposite directions, depending on which host pathways (contact rate, susceptibility or host demography) are most altered by the addition of resources to the environment. Broadly, these responses were qualitatively consistent across all parasite types, emphasising the importance of identifying general trade-offs between provisioning-altered parameters. Despite the qualitative consistency in responses to provisioning across parasite types, we predicted notable quantitative differences between parasites, with directly transmitted parasites (those conforming to SIR and SIS frameworks) predicted to show the strongest responses to provisioning among those examined, whereas the vector-borne parasites showed negligible responses to provisioning. As such, these analyses suggest that different parasites may show different scales of response to the same provisioning scenario, even within the same host population. This highlights the importance of knowing key aspects of host–parasite biology, to understand and predict epidemiological responses to provisioning for any specific host–parasite system.","2022","2022-07-08 12:00:55","2022-07-08 12:01:16","2022-07-08 12:00:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.13751","","","","","epidemiology; disease ecology; Apodemus sylvaticus; compartmental models; host–parasite interactions; provisioning; resource levels; supplemental feeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately 260 species have been recognized and grouped recently into a simplified system of 15 subgenera. Most of the species are nest-building and primitively eusocial. Species of Bombus have been more intensely studied than any other lineages of bees with the exception of the honey bees. However, most bumble bee fossils are poorly described and documented, making their placement relative to other Bombus uncertain. A large portion of the known and presumed bumble bee fossils were re-examined in an attempt to better understand their affinities with extant Bombini. The taxonomic affinities of fossil specimens were re-assessed based on morphological features and previous descriptions, and for 13 specimens based on geometric morphometrics of forewing shape. None of the specimens coming from Eocene and Oligocene deposits were assigned within the contemporary shape space of any subgenus of Bombus. It is shown that Calyptapis florissantensis Cockerell, 1906 (Eocene-Oligocene boundary, Florissant shale, Colorado, USA) and Oligobombus cuspidatus Antropov, 2014 (Late Eocene, Bembridge Marls) likely belong to stem-group Bombini.

In the Miocene, affinities of fossils with derived subgenera of Bombus s. l. increased, and some are included in the shape space of contemporary subgenera: Cullumanobombus (i.e., B. pristinus Unger, 1867, B. randeckensis Wappler &amp; Engel, 2012, and B. trophonius Prokop, Dehon, Michez &amp; Engel, 2017), Melanobombus (i.e., B. cerdanyensis Dehon, De Meulemeester &amp; Engel, 2014), and Mendacibombus (i.e., B. beskonakensis (Nel &amp; Petrulevičius, 2003), new combination), agreeing with previous estimates of diversification.","2019-11-21","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:25:41","71-118","","","891","","","","","","","","","","en","2022 Manuel Dehon, Michael S.

While no difference in bumble bee genetic structure was detected between invaded and uninvaded sites, we show that I. glandulifera occurrence was significantly correlated with a decrease in the prevalence of Apicystis bombi but not the prevalence of three other parasite species (i.e., Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, Nosema ceranae, and Nosema sp.). Regarding our investigations, this effect was likely not due to variation in local bumble bee population fitness before I. glandulifera flowering, nor to the relative abundance of other pollinators such as Apis mellifera, but the unique chemical composition (i.e., polyphenol rich) of the pollen of I. glandulifera remained as an interesting hypothesis. Whereas B. pascuorum queens probably colonize all the potential nesting sites in an area, invaded by I. glandulifera or not, the abundance of polyphenol ampelopsin in pollen from I. glandulifera pollen might reduce local parasite prevalence. Our field study confirms that bumble bee parasite prevalence is potentially related to the particular chemical composition of collected pollen. Plant traits such as secondary metabolite occurrence could play a key role in the health and conservation of bumble bees.","2019","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:31:54","e02804","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.2804","","","","","conservation; bumble bee; insect pollinator; invasive plants; parasites; population genetic diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This issue is exemplified in bumble bees (Bombus), where species can exhibit high colour variation across their range, but otherwise exhibit little morphological variation to distinguish them from close relatives. We examine the species status of one of the most abundant North American bumble bees, Bombus bifarius Cresson, which historically comprised two major taxa, bifarius s.s. and nearcticus. These lineages are recognized primarily by red and black variation in their mid-abdominal coloration; however, a continuum from black (nearcticus) to red (bifarius s.s.) variation has led to their historic synonymization. Integrating mitochondrial and nuclear data and whole-genome sequencing, we reveal a high level of both mitochondrial and nuclear divergence delimiting two morphologically cryptic species – the red bifarius s.s. and the colour-variable (black to red) nearcticus. Population genomic analysis supports an absence of recent genomic admixture and a strong population structure between the two clades, even in sympatry. Species distribution models predict partially differentiated niches between the genetically inferred clades with annual precipitation being a leading differentiating variable. The bifarius s.s. lineage also occupies significantly higher elevations, with regions of sympatry being among the highest elevations in nearcticus. Our data also support a subspecies-level divergence between the broadly distributed nearcticus and the island population vancouverensis. In this paper, we formally recognize the two species, Bombus bifarius Cresson and Bombus vancouverensis Cresson, the latter including the subspecies B. vancouverensis vancouverensis comb.n. and B. vancouverensis nearcticus comb.n., with vancouverensis the name bearer due to year priority.","2020","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:58","635-652","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/syen.12419","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bees are, in this context, a popular example of a highly diversified group of pollinators whose collapse is a major concern given the invaluable ecosystem services they provide. Amongst them, bumblebees (Bombus) have increasingly drawn the attention of scientists due to their dramatic population declines globally. This regression has converted them into popular conservation entities, making them the second most studied group of bees worldwide. However, in addition to have become relevant models in the fields of ecology, evolution and biogeography, bumblebees have also been used as models for studying wild bee decline and conservation worldwide. Integrating evidence from the comparative ecology and resilience of bumblebees and wild bees, I discuss the relevance of using Bombus as radars for wild bee decline worldwide. Responses of bumblebees to environmental changes are generally not comparable with those of wild bees because of their relatively long activity period, their inherent sensitivity to high temperatures, their relatively generalist diet breadth and many aspects arising from their eusocial behavior. Moreover, important differences in the available historical data between bumblebees and other bees make comparisons of conservation status even more arduous. Overall, these results reinforce the need for conservation actions that consider a higher level of understanding of ecological diversity in wild bees, highlight the need for an updated and more extensive sampling of these organisms, and emphasize that more caution is required when extrapolating trends from model species.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:04","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst negative population trends within this functional group have understandably received much attention in recent decades, another facet of global changes has been overshadowed: species undergoing expansion. Here, we review the factors and traits that have allowed a fraction of the pollinating entomofauna to take advantage of global environmental change. Sufficient mobility, high resistance to acute heat stress, and inherent adaptation to warmer climates appear to be key traits that allow pollinators to persist and even expand in the face of climate change. An overall flexibility in dietary and nesting requirements is common in expanding species, although niche specialization can also drive expansion under specific contexts. The numerous consequences of wild and domesticated pollinator expansions, including competition for resources, pathogen spread, and hybridization with native wildlife, are also discussed. Overall, we show that the traits and factors involved in the success stories of expanding pollinators are mostly species specific and context dependent, rendering generalizations of ‘winning traits’ complicated. This work illustrates the increasing need to consider expansion and its numerous consequences as significant facets of global changes and encourages efforts to monitor the impacts of expanding insect pollinators, particularly exotic species, on natural ecosystems.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:26:25","2755-2770","","6","96","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12777","","","","","conservation; invasive species; global change; bees; bumblebees; butterflies; exotic species; expansion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effective development of conservation tools in order to counteract these changes relies on unambiguous taxonomic determination and delineation. In this study, we focus on an endemic bumblebee species recorded only from the highest altitudes of the Sierra Nevada (Spain), Bombus reinigiellus (Rasmont, 1983). The species has the smallest range of any European bumblebee, along with a restricted diet and an inability to disperse because of its isolated montane distribution, making it an appropriate conservation target. However, through an integrative taxonomic approach including genetics, morphometrics and semio-chemistry, we demonstrate the conspecificity of this taxon with one of the most common and widespread bumblebee species of Europe, Bombus hortorum (L. 1761). We assign a subspecies status to this endemic taxon (Bombus hortorum reinigiellus comb. nov.) shown to be different in colour and morphology but also in wing shape and relative wing size compared to the other conspecific subspecies. Following our taxonomic revision, we reassessed the IUCN conservation status of Bombus hortorum both at the continental and Spanish scale.

Some of the taxa found to be threatened are the often rare socially parasitic bumble bees. Among these, the socially parasitic bumble bee, Bombus flavidus Eversmann, has uncertain species status. Although multiple separate species allied with B. flavidus have been suggested, until recently, recognition of two species, a Nearctic Bombus fernaldae (Franklin) and Palearctic B. flavidus, was favored. Limited genetic data, however, suggested that even these could be a single widespread species. We addressed the species status of this lineage using an integrative taxonomic approach, combining cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and nuclear sequencing, wing morphometrics, and secretions used for mate attraction, and explored patterns of color polymorphism that have previously confounded taxonomy in this lineage. Our results support the conspecificity of fernaldae and flavidus; however, we revealed a distinct population within this broader species confined to eastern North America. This makes the distribution of the social parasite B. flavidus the broadest of any bumble bee, broader than the known distribution of any nonparasitic bumble bee species. Color polymorphisms are retained across the range of the species, but may be influenced by local mimicry complexes. Following these results, B. flavidusEversmann, 1852 is synonymized with Bombus fernaldae (Franklin, 1911) syn. nov. and a subspecific status, Bombus flavidus appalachiensisssp. nov., is assigned to the lineage ranging from the Appalachians to the eastern boreal regions of the United States and far southeastern Canada.","2021-03-01","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:29:28","5","","2","5","","Insect Systematics and Diversity","Diversification Pattern of the Widespread Holarctic Cuckoo Bumble Bee, Bombus flavidus (Hymenoptera","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amongst these threats, many synergistic drivers, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, increasing use of agrochemicals, decreasing resource diversity, as well as climate change, are known to affect wild and managed bees. Therefore, reliable indicators for pollinator sensitivity to such threats are needed. Biological traits, such as phenotype (e.g. shape, size and asymmetry) and storage reserves (e.g. fat body size), are important pollinator traits linked to reproductive success, immunity, resilience and foraging efficiency and, therefore, could serve as valuable markers of bee health and pollination service potential.This data paper contains an extensive dataset of wing morphology and fat body content for the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) sampled at 128 sites across eight European countries in landscape gradients dominated by two major bee-pollinated crops (apple and oilseed rape), before and after focal crop bloom and potential pesticide exposure. The dataset also includes environmental metrics of each sampling site, namely landscape structure and pesticide use. The data offer the opportunity to test whether variation in the phenotype and fat bodies of bees is structured by environmental factors and drivers of global change.

From the species allied to Andrena (T. ) gelriae van der Vecht, 1927, Andrena (T. ) gredana Warncke, 1975 stat. nov. from Spain and Portugal is raised to species status, and Andrena (T. ) levante Wood & Praz sp. nov. from southeastern Spain is newly described. Furthermore, Andrena (T. ) benoisti Wood & Praz sp. nov. is described, having previously been referred to as Andrena (T. ) wilkella beaumonti Benoist, 1961. Andrena (T. ) beaumonti stat. rev. is itself distinct and restricted to the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Outside of the subgenus Taeniandrena, Andrena (Euandrena) fortipunctata Wood sp. nov. and Andrena (Charitandrena) hattorfiana nigricauda Wood subsp. nov. are described from Spain, and Andrena (Notandrena) juliana Wood sp. nov. is described from Spain and Portugal. The male of Andrena (Lepidandrena) baetica Wood, 2020 is also described. Andrena (Euandrena) impressa Warncke, 1967 stat. nov. is raised to species status, displaying a West Mediterranean distribution. Finally, a further two species of Andrena are newly recorded for Spain, Andrena laurivora Warncke, 1974 and Andrena confinis Stoeckhert, 1930. Altogether, these findings reinforce the fact that our understanding of the taxonomy and distribution of Andrena in southern Europe remains incomplete.","2021-07-12","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:32:13","147-193","","","758","","","Revisions to the faunas of Andrena of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco with the descriptions of four new species (Hymenoptera","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2021 Thomas J.

Though predominantly generalists, some bumble bee species seem to have restricted dietary choices. It is unclear whether restricted diets in bumble bees are inherent or a function of local conditions due to a lack of data for many species across different regions. The objective of this study was to determine whether bumble bee species displayed specific patterns of pollen collection, and whether patterns were influenced by phylogenetic relatedness or tongue length, a trait known to be associated with structuring floral visitation. Bumble bee pollen collection patterns were quantified from 4,132 pollen loads taken from 58 bumble bee species, representing 24% of the pollen-collecting diversity of this genus. Phylogenetic trait mapping showed a conserved pattern of dietary dissimilarity across species, but not for dietary breadth. Dietary dissimilarity was driven by collection of Fabaceae, with the most similar species collecting around 50%–60% of their diet from this botanical family. The proportion of the diet collected from Fabaceae also showed a conserved phylogenetic signal. Greater collection of Fabaceae was associated with longer tongue lengths, with shorter tongued species focusing on alternative botanical families. However, this result was largely driven by phylogenetic relatedness, not tongue length per se. These results demonstrate that, though generalists, bumble bees are still subject to dietary restrictions that constrain their foraging choices. These dietary constraints have implications for their persistence should their core resources decline in abundance.","2021","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:32:41","2421-2430","","10","90","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.13553","","","","","Fabaceae; Bombus; dietary specialisation; museum specimens; pollen analysis; tongue length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we surveyed wild bees using a standardised protocol at an unprecedented scale including 62 commercial apple orchards in Western and Central Europe (i) to validate recent findings on pollinator community divergence as measured by common survey methods (netting and pan trapping) using conventional and alternative biodiversity metrics (phylogenetic and functional diversity), and (ii) to investigate the impact of climatic variation on the patterns observed. Our results confirm the significant divergence in pollinator communities measured using the two common methods at the larger, sub-continental scale, and we provide evidence for a significant influence of climate on the magnitude of pollinator community divergence (beta diversity and its turnover component) between survey methods, particularly when comparing colder to warmer sites and regions. We also found that warmer sites are more dissimilar than colder sites in terms of species composition, functional traits, or phylogenetic affinities. This result probably stems from the comparatively larger species pool in Southern Europe and because apple flowers are accessible to a wide spectrum of pollinator species; hence, two distant survey localities in Southern Europe are more likely to differ significantly in their pollinator community. Collectively, our results demonstrate the spatially-varying patterns of pollinator communities associated with common survey methods along a climate gradient and at the sub-continental scale in Europe.","2022-05-01","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:36:22","2022-08-25 21:29:03","107871","","","329","","Agric.

However, deproteinization of non-vesicular tRNA halves does not affect their retention in size-exclusion chromatography. Thus, we considered alternative explanations for their extracellular stability. In-silico analysis of the sequence of these tRNA-derived fragments showed that tRNAGly 5′ halves can form homodimers or heterodimers with tRNAGlu 5′ halves. This capacity is virtually unique to glycine tRNAs. By analyzing synthetic oligonucleotides by size exclusion chromatography, we provide evidence that dimerization is possible in vitro. tRNA halves with single point substitutions preventing dimerization are degraded faster both in controlled nuclease digestion assays and after transfection in cells, showing that dimerization can stabilize tRNA halves against the action of cellular nucleases. Finally, we give evidence supporting dimerization of endogenous tRNAGlyGCC 5′ halves inside cells.

For these reasons, a Bayesian coalescent Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of complete genome sequences of ZIKV strains recently isolated in the American continent was performed. The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of ZIKV strains in different genetic lineages and co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages in several countries in the region.

They offer advantages as delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids such as small RNAs. Loading of desired nucleic acids into EVs can be achieved by electroporation or transfection once purified. An attractive alternative is to transfect cells with the desired small RNAs and harness the cellular machinery for RNA sorting into the EVs. This possibility has been less explored because cells are believed to secrete only specific RNAs. However, we hypothesized that, even in the presence of selective secretion, concentration-driven RNA sorting to EVs would still be feasible. To show this, we transfected cells with glycine 5ʹ tRNA halves, which we have previously shown to better resist RNases. We then measured their levels in EVs and in recipient cells and found that, in contrast to unstable RNAs of random sequence, these tRNA halves were present in vesicles and in recipient cells in amounts proportional to the concentration of RNA used for transfection. Similar efficiencies were obtained with other stable oligonucleotides of random sequence. Our results demonstrate that RNA stability is a key factor needed to maintain high intracellular concentrations, a prerequisite for efficient non-selective RNA sorting to EVs and delivery to cells. Given that glycine 5ʹ tRNA halves belong to the group of stress-induced tRNA fragments frequently detected in extracellular space and biofluids, we propose that upregulation of extracellular tRNA fragments is consequential to cellular stress and might be involved in intercellular signalling.","2020-08-02","2022-09-14 15:33:37","2022-09-14 15:33:37","2022-09-14 15:29:16","1168-1182","","8","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.1708548 PMID: 31885318","","","","","exosomes; intercellular communication; secretion; tiRNAs; vesicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk of infection amongst these additional contacts was similar to contacts exposed during the standard tracing window and significantly higher than symptomatic individuals in a control group, leading to 42% more cases identified as direct contacts of an index case.

U. albicornis is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. U. albicornis occurs throughout Canada and continental USA and has established in northern Spain, and probably in southern France (based on two specimens caught in two sites) and Japan (based on one individual caught in one site). It attacks mostly stumps or fallen or weakened trees of at least 20 species of Pinaceae (Abies spp., Larix spp., Picea spp., Pinus spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga spp.) and of Cupressaceae (Thuja plicata). In Spain, the females ﬂy between May and September with a peak in August and September. The eggs are deposited into the sapwood, together with mucus containing a venom and a white-rot wood-decay basidiomycete, either Amylostereum chailletii or A. areolatum. Each fungus is symbiotic with the insect. The larvae feed on wood infected by the fungus. All immature stages live in the host sapwood. In British Columbia, the lifecycle of the pest lasts 2 years but has not been fully characterised elsewhere. The wood of the host trees is impacted by decay due to the fungus, and structurally impaired by the larval galleries. U. albicornis can be carried in conifer wood, solid wood packaging material (SWPM) or plants for planting. Wood from North America is regulated by 2019/2072 (Annex VII) while SWPM is managed according to ISPM 15. The pathway plants for planting is largely closed by prohibition, with the exception of Thuja spp. Climatic conditions in several EU member states are conducive for establishment and the main host plants are widespread in those areas. Further spread and introduction of U. albicornis is likely to decrease the quality of host wood and may inﬂuence forest diversity by selectively affecting conifers. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of additional entry and further spread, and there is a potential for biological control.

This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. T. parvicornis is a soft-scale insect native to North America and has been introduced to the Caribbean region and the EU. It has been present in Italy since 2014 (Abruzzo, Campania, Lazio, and Apulia regions) and in France since 2021 (Provence–Alpes–Co^te d’Azur region) and is under ofﬁcial control. It develops on Pinus spp. (Pinaceae), feeding on the needles and twigs, especially on new growth. It is sexually reproductive, has one or more generations each year (three in southern Italy), and adult females overwinter on the Pinus needles. It has a high fecundity, up to 1,014 eggs per female in Italy, with an average of 199 eggs for the summer generation and 730 for the overwintering generation. The main natural dispersal stage is the ﬁrst instar, which crawls over the plant or may be dispersed further by wind and animals. The species can be transported over longer distances with plants for planting. Large populations cause yellowing, needle loss, reduction in growth and recruitment, ﬂagging, dieback and tree mortality. It has had a signiﬁcant impact to P. pinea (stone pine) in Italy and caused a catastrophic decline of P. caribbea var. bahamensis (Caribbean pine) in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Adult and immature T. parvicornis could enter the EU with Pinus plants for planting; however, the import of Pinus from third countries where the scale is found is prohibited.

T. perseae is a tropical and subtropical species that originated in the Neotropical region and has now spread and established in the USA (California and Florida), Israel and Lebanon. T. perseae is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is oligophagous on Lauraceae and most frequently reported on avocado (Persea americana), on which it is considered a minor or secondary pest. No evidence was found indicating damage to other plants. T. perseae larvae develop on the foliage and don’t attack the fruit. The number of generations per year varies between one and ten. High populations may promote the growth of black sooty moulds on the foliage and fruit, and adults feeding on the buds can lead to deformed immature leaves and premature leaf drop. However, T. perseae populations are usually effectively controlled by hymenopteran parasitoids, at least one of which (Cales noacki) is widespread in the EU. The producers of organic avocados in the EU could encourage the use of C. noacki, although occasional outbreaks of T. perseae could temporarily impact the fruit quality. Adults disperse naturally by flying and all stages can be moved over long distances by the trade of infested plant material. Plants for planting provide potential pathways for entry and spread in the EU. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern EU countries are conducive for establishment. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the risk. T. perseae satisfies all of the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

Each female produces approximately 80 eggs which are laid on the bark. The larvae live in the phloem and tunnel into the xylem where they pupate. Infested trees show injuries including longitudinal slits in the bark, caused by larval activity next to the surface and round exit holes from which frass emerges. The females respond to a male sex pheromone, which has not been developed into a detection method. The adults spread by flight as suggested by the local expansion of damage in Europe. However, wood packaging material and wooden objects can also be a pathway as suggested by interceptions in Germany and the USA.

The pest is univoltine and the adults emerge between May and August. The adults live only for 1 day. Each female oviposits in batches on developing needles. The neonate larvae crawl to the base of the needle fascicle and create a gall in which they feed gregariously by sap sucking. The third-instar larvae leave the galls in November, overwinter in a cocoon in the soil and pupate at the end of the winter. Degree day models have been developed to predict adult emergence. Survival of overwintering stages is poor below 15°C and above 30°C. The pest can be detected by its symptoms (stunted or dead needles, galls at the base of infected needle fascicles), and identified using morphological characters or the mitochondrial COI gene. T. japonensis is one of the major forest pests in the Republic of Korea, where 1.7 million trees were cut to control it in 2014–2015. It flies uneasily (a few hundred metres) but can be transported in galls on Pinus plants for planting, including artificially dwarfed plants, or with cut branches. Climate matching and host tree distribution suggest that T. japonensis would be able to establish and have an impact in the EU territory. T. japonensis satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:08:54","e07088","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; pine needle gall midge; Pinus spp.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This oligophagous species, which feeds on Citrus spp. fruits, is known to occur in China (provinces of Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Sichuan). First-generation adults emerge in April and oviposit on the peduncle and calyx of citrus fruits. Larvae feed on the albedo (the white layer between skin and pulp) of the fruit, which they tunnel. Infested fruit most often drop prematurely. Larvae pupate either within the fallen fruit or in the soil. This species has three main peaks of activity (May, June–July, August–September) and four generations per year in its native range. Mature larvae from the last generation are the overwintering stage. Potential entry pathways for R. citrifrugis, such as Citrus spp. plants for planting with foliage and soil/growing media, and soil/growing media can be considered as closed. The citrus fruit pathway remains open from countries where R. citrifrugis is known to occur. Indeed, this species was intercepted in fresh pomelos 11 times from December 2020 to January 2021 in the EU. Should R. citrifrugis enter the EU, the ample availability of hosts (Citrus spp.) and the climatic conditions in citrus-growing areas of southern EU Member States would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Economic impact in citrus production is anticipated if establishment occurs. R. citrifrugis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. There is uncertainty about the nomenclature of R. citrifrugis and its exact host range.

P. apicalis is a polyphagous pest native to New Zealand. The majority of its life cycle is spent inside tree wood, but it does not directly feed on plant tissue, instead larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus (Sporothrix nothofagi which is pathogenic to Nothofagus spp.) vectored by adults and introduced when they bore tunnels into the host. P. apicalis feeds within a wide range of live, often stressed trees, in dead or dying hardwood and softwood trees, and fallen or felled trees. Successful reproduction can occur inside a number of living tree species including Castanea sativa, Pinus spp. and Ulmus spp. P. apicalis is not known to have established outside of New Zealand although findings have been reported in Australia. Whilst there are no records of interceptions of this species in the EU, platypodines are intercepted with solid wood packing material (SWPM) and Platypus species, but not P. apicalis, have been intercepted with wooden logs in Japan. Host plants for planting also provide a potential pathway. Hosts are grown widely across the EU in areas with climates comparable to those in New Zealand where the pest occurs suggesting that conditions in the EU are suitable for its establishment. If introduced into the EU, adults could disperse naturally by flight, perhaps tens or hundreds of metres. The movement of infested wood and host plants for planting within the EU could facilitate spread. Economic impacts in forestry and timber industries would result from the galleries created by P. apicalis and from wood staining caused by the symbiotic fungus.

Large populations were detected in northern Israel in 2016. It has not been reported within the EU. It is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It reproduces sexually and there are up to 11 generations per year in India. The estimated minimum, optimum and maximum temperature thresholds for the adult females are 13.9, 28.4 and 32.1°C, respectively. First-instar nymphs may move to neighbouring plants by crawling, or be passively dispersed by wind, or hitchhiking on clothing, equipment or animals. It is highly polyphagous, feeding on plants in 172 genera and 54 families. It is an important pest of custard apple (Annona spp.), papaya (Carica papaya) and Hibiscus spp. It also feeds on a wide range of plants cultivated in the EU such as eggplant (Solanum melongena), avocado (Persea americana), citrus (Citrus spp.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), guava (Psidium guajava), mango (Mangifera indica), passionfruit (Passiﬂora edulis), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Plants for planting, fruits, vegetables and cut ﬂowers are the main potential pathways for entry of P. marginatus into the EU. Climatic conditions in the warmest areas of Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain, where host plants occur, would likely allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Reductions in yield and quality of some cultivated hosts including Annona spp., Hibiscus spp. and papaya are anticipated if establishment occurs. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and spread. P. marginatus meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2023-03","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-13 13:41:42","","","3","21","","EFS2","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

O. perseae is a tropical species that originated in Mesoamerica and has now spread and established in California, Florida, Hawaii, Morocco, southern Europe and Israel. Within the EU, it is established in Italy, Portugal and Spain. O. perseae is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is polyphagous, feeding on plants in 20 genera in 17 families. It is most frequently reported on avocado (Persea americana), where it is considered a key pest. No evidence was found indicating damage to other crops. O. perseae live on leaves and do not attack the fruit. Populations usually grow exponentially at the beginning of summer and decline at the end of this season. High population densities can cause severe defoliation, resulting in downgrading of fruit through sunburn. However, this type of damage is common only if trees additionally suffer from water stress. The lack of additional avocado pests in the EU, which facilitates the production of organic avocados, is jeopardised by the occurrence of this mite, as it may require pesticide applications. This is why O. perseae is considered an important pest of avocados in Spain, where more than 80% of EU avocado production occurs. Natural dispersal is restricted to neighbouring trees. However, human-assisted movement can result in long-distance spread. Plants for planting provide potential pathways for further entry and spread, including O. perseae-free EU MS where avocados are grown (i.e. Cyprus, France, Greece). Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern EU countries are conducive for establishment. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of further entry and spread.

This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. The polyphagous mite feeds on more than 50 host plants including tropical fruits such as mangoes and avocados and temperate fruits such as pears, peaches, pomegranates and grapes. It occurs in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America. O. mangiferus is multivoltine and can develop throughout the year as long as temperatures are above 12°C. The species produces dense webs on the above-ground parts of their host plants, where all stages of development (egg, larva, nymph and adult) can be found. This species is considered a pest of mango, grapevine, lychee and pomegranate, mostly in areas with hotter climates than those occurring in the EU. Potential entry pathways for O. mangiferus include plants for planting with foliage, fruit and cut flowers. Plants for planting of a few hosts (i.e. Pinus, Prunus, Pyrus, Rosa, Vitis and Arecaceae) are banned from entering into the EU from countries where O. mangiferus is known to occur and can be considered as closed entry pathways. However, other plants for planting, as well as the fruit and the cut flowers pathways remain open. There are no EU records of interception. Should O. mangiferus enter the EU, the ample availability of hosts and the climatic conditions in the EU would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread, at least in southern MSs, where economic impact in different fruit production (e.g. pomegranate, mango and grape) is anticipated.

N. lugens is widespread in Asia where it is native; it also occurs in Oceania where it is naturalised. N. lugens is not known to be present in the EU and is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is a monophagous species and a major pest of rice (Oryza sativa). High populations of planthoppers cause leaves to initially turn orange yellow before becoming brown and dry and this is a condition called ‘hopperburn’ that kills the plant. N. lugens can also transmit plant viruses. It can complete 12 generations per year in tropical areas, where it resides year-round. N. lugens can undertake longdistance migration of up to 500 km from tropical areas to form transient populations in sub-tropical and temperate areas but due to low temperatures and absence of rice plants during the winter it does not establish in such areas. Entry to the EU via migration is unlikely given the distance from tropical rice growing areas. A possible but unlikely potential pathway is the import of infested rice seedlings, although we have no evidence that such trade exists. In the EU, rice is mainly planted from seed; when transplanted, it is sourced locally. N. lugens is very unlikely to survive year-round in the EU due to unsuitable climate and lack of hosts during the winter. Consequently, the pest is very unlikely to become established in the EU territory. Nevertheless, there are measures available to further reduce the likelihood of entry, establishment and spread of N. lugens within the EU. N. lugens does not satisfy the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2023-05","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-18 16:17:00","","","5","21","","EFS2","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M. massonianae occurs in western China and has been reported as a pest of Pinus massoniana (Chinese red pine) and P. thunbergii (Japanese black pine). These hosts occur in the EU as ornamental/amenity trees. Other scales in the Matsucoccus genus feed on a variety of Pinus species and the host range of M. massonianae could be wider than is currently recorded. There is one generation per year. All stages occur on the branches and stems of hosts with developing nymphs and adult females feeding under the bark on the phloem vessels of the host. Symptoms include the yellowing/browning of host needles, early needle drop, desiccation of shoots and bark necrosis. The most serious infestations occur in hosts aged 8–25 years old and there can be some host mortality. In principle, host plants for planting and plant products such as cut branches and wood with bark could provide entry pathways into the EU. However, prohibitions on the import of Pinus from non-European third countries close these pathways. In China, M. massonianae occurs in regions with temperate humid conditions and hot summers. These conditions are also found in parts of southern EU. Were M. massonianae to establish in the EU, it is conceivable that it could expand its host range; however, this remains uncertain. M. massonianae satisﬁes all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. Some uncertainty exists over the magnitude of potential impacts.","2022-11","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-13 13:45:00","","","11","20","","EFS2","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This oligophagous species, which feeds on fruit and leaves of Solanum aethiopicum (Ethiopian eggplant) and S. melongena (eggplant), is known to occur in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Liberia, Senegal, Uganda). Adults oviposit on leaves and newly hatched caterpillars can bore into shoots, causing wilting and dieback, before moving into the fruit, which they tunnel. Damage may be visible only if the fruit is cut open. A single aubergine can be infested by up to 20 larvae. Mature larvae abandon the fruit to pupate in a cocoon in the soil. Adult moths fly for short distances only in darkness. Potential entry pathways for L. pseudorbonalis, such as Solanum spp. plants for planting and soil/growing media are regulated and can be considered as closed. The fruit and leaves pathways remain open from countries where L. pseudorbonalis is known to occur. Indeed, this species was intercepted in the EU with S. aethiopicum eight times from January to June 2021.

Economic impact in aubergine production is anticipated if establishment occurs. L. pseudorbonalis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. Because this is a recently described species, there are knowledge gaps related to the biology of this moth and its distribution.

Following taxonomic revision, literature reporting L. orbonalis from sub-Saharan Africa should be regarded as referring to members of a complex of other species of Leucinodes native to Africa and not as referring to L. orbonalis. L. orbonalis is not present in the EU and is not a regulated EU pest. L. orbonalis is a major pest of Solanum melongena (eggplant) in Asia where larvae feed within leaves, stems, shoots and fruits. Larvae can also feed on a range of other plants, mostly within Solanaceae although L. orbonalis is generally not reported as a pest of crops other than S. melongena. However, in recent years L. orbonalis has emerged as a pest of Solanum tuberosum in south-west India. In tropical areas there can be 10 generations per year if conditions are suitable.

NESC occur worldwide, and some species are important forest pests. Species can be identified using taxonomic keys and molecular methods. Most NESC species (bark beetles) live in the inner bark of their hosts (phloem and cambium), while the remaining species mostly colonise the sapwood (ambrosia beetles). Bark- and ambrosia beetles are often associated with symbiotic fungi, which behave as pathogens towards the host trees, or are used as food by ambrosia beetle larvae. The larvae live in individual tunnels or in communal chambers. Pupation occurs in the wood or in the bark. Some species are semi- or multivoltine, others are monovoltine. Some species attack and kill living, apparently healthy trees. Other species specialise in weakened, dying or dead trees. The pathways for entry are cut branches, cones, round wood with or without bark, sawn wood with or without bark, wood packaging material, bark, manufactured wood items and wood chips and plants for planting (including seeds) of conifers.

N. andropogonis is a tropical and subtropical species that originates in south central Asia and has recently established in Iran and Iraq. N. andropogonis is not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It is oligophagous on Poaceae and most frequently reported on sugarcane (Saccharum ofﬁcinarum), on which it has become an important emerging pest in western Iran. The larvae feed on the foliage and stalks and can cause a reduction of photosynthesis rate and growth. In heavy infestations, the sugar purity and content are greatly decreased. Honeydew egested by feeding N. andropogonis larvae can promote the growth of black sooty mould over the host. No evidence was found indicating economic damage to other grasses. The ornamental grass hosts Andropogon sp. and Imperata cylindrica are ornamental grasses in the subfamily Panicoideae and are exempt from a general prohibition on Poaceae entering the EU and together with fresh sugarcane, provide potential pathways for entry. An estimated threshold for development from egg to adult of 7.2°C with approximately 500 degree days required for a generation suggests that climatic conditions, together with the availability of grass hosts in the southern EU, would support establishment. Adults disperse naturally by ﬂying and all stages can be moved over long distances by the trade of infested plant material. The pest has the potential to impact sugarcane production in Portugal and Spain. N. andropogonis satisﬁes all of the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. However, this conclusion has high uncertainties regarding the likelihood of entry and the magnitude of potential impact within the EU as the insect is only recorded as an economically important pest in Iran, and its host range is poorly known and understood.","2022-11","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-13 13:44:58","","","11","20","","EFS2","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M. disstria is a North American polyphagous leaf-eating pest primarily feeding on deciduous trees belonging to the genera Acer, Malus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus and Tilia. It is a univoltine species. Eggs are laid on twigs and branches. Larvae emerge in the spring to feed on buds and fresh leaves. Host plants can be completely defoliated although they often refoliate and recover within a few weeks. Nevertheless, three consecutive years of heavy defoliation or repeated periods of defoliation combined with drought can cause extensive tree mortality. As such, M. disstria is regarded as one of the most serious hardwood forestry insect pests in North America. Population upsurges leading to outbreaks are cyclical, generally nine to 13 years apart and can last 2–3 years. Outbreaks have been reported in eastern North America since the late 18th century. Outbreaks in western Canada have spanned up to 200,000 km2. Plants for planting, cut branches and isolated bark provide pathways for entry. Host availability and climate suitability suggest that large parts of the EU would be suitable for establishment. The pest could spread naturally by flight within the EU. Eggs on plants for planting could also facilitate spread. The introduction of M. disstria into the EU could lead to serious outbreaks causing significant damage to forest, orchard and amenity trees and shrubs. Phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit the entry and spread of this species. M. disstria satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 15:07:03","e07208","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; forest tent caterpillar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its larvae primarily feed on the needles of Pinus densiﬂora and P. thunbergii and can also feed on P. strobus, P. rigida, P. taeda and P. tabuliformis. The pest can have one or two generations per year; winter is mostly spent as ﬁfth instar larvae in the soil. Adults emerge in July and August and females lay egg masses of 200–300 eggs on coniferous host needles. Natural enemies are described as signiﬁcant factors of population density changes in Japan and the Republic of Korea. The pest can be detected visually, and there are morphological keys as well as molecular markers allowing identiﬁcation.

Other economically important hosts suffering impacts include beans (Fabaceae), wheat and maize (Poaceae). Young plants are particularly vulnerable to adults and nymphs feeding on tender leaves and growing points, which can cause yield losses. B. hilaris occurs in Africa and Asia and has spread to North America (USA and Mexico) and South America (Chile) where there are multiple generations per year. It is not widely distributed in the EU but has been established in Malta and on the Italian island of Pantelleria, south west of Sicily, since the 1970s where it is an economically important pest of capers. The reasons why it has not spread further within southern Europe are unknown. B. hilaris is not a regulated pest in the EU. It could further enter and spread within the EU via the import and movement of host plants or as a hitchhiking species forming aggregations in conveyances and amongst non-plant traded goods.

D. superans is a major pest of conifer forests in Japan, northeast China and non-European Russia. However, reports of damage are to conifer species not grown in EU forestry. Larix gmelinii and Pinus pumila are regarded as major hosts. Eggs are laid on host needles and developing larvae feed on host foliage. Larvae overwinter in the soil. In its native range, D. superans usually takes one or two years to develop. In principle, host plants for planting and plant products, such as cut branches and wood with bark, could provide pathways into the EU. However, prohibitions on the import of Abies, Cedrus, Larix, Picea, Pinus and Tsuga from areas where D. superans occurs closes such pathways. Nevertheless, a derogation for specific dwarfed Pinus plants from Japan exists. Climates similar to those in some of its existing range occur in the EU. Norway spruce (Picea abies) is a known host in Japan although reports of any impact are lacking. Experiments on the related species D. sibiricus indicated that larvae were able to develop on forestry conifer species occurring in the EU, but which are found outside the native range of D. sibiricus. Were D. superans to be introduced into the EU, impacts on P. abies are possible and it is conceivable that D. superans could expand its host range, as seems possible with D. sibiricus. However, this remains uncertain. Other hosts are grown in the EU as ornamentals or amenity trees. D. superans satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. Some uncertainty exists over the magnitude of potential environmental and economic impacts.","2022","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2023-05-21 18:53:46","2022-10-15 14:47:13","e07525","","8","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","pest risk; plant health; quarantine; plant pest; Conifer; Larch caterpillar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. Adults of A. kakogawana overwinter in broad-leaved and mixed forests and move to vineyards in the spring where there may be up to four generations, before adults move back to forests during late summer–early autumn to overwinter, possibly under diapause. A. kakogawana has a restricted host range (Vitis spp. and Parthenocissus quinquefolia). It is native to Eastern Asia, from where it moved westwards reaching southern Russia in 1999, and subsequently Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia in 2020. A. kakogawana develops on the abaxial side of the leaves causing chlorotic spots that reduce grape quality. Plants for planting of Vitis L. are banned from entering the EU except from Switzerland, where A. kakogawana is not known to occur. Therefore, this can be considered as a closed entry pathway. However, other plants for planting including the host P. quinquefolia and many broad-leaved trees where overwintering takes place, as well as isolated bark and wood with bark provide potential pathways which are partly regulated but remain open. There are no EU records of interception. Additional introductions and further spread of A. kakogawana into/within the EU, coupled with the ample availability of grapevines and the climatic conditions would most probably allow successful establishment in most EU member states. Should this happen, economic impact in table and wine grapes is anticipated.

Using whole genome sequencing, the aim of our study was to clarify badger contribution to bTB transmission in this area. We used a Bayesian evolutionary model, to infer phylogenetic trees and migration rates between two pathogen populations defined by their host-species. In order to account for sampling bias, sub-population structure was inferred using the marginal approximation of the structured coalescent (Mascot) implemented in BEAST2. We included 167 SB0821 strains (21 isolated from badgers and 146 from cattle) and identified 171 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We selected a HKY model and a strict molecular clock. We estimated a badger-to-cattle transition rate (median: 2.2 transitions/lineage/year) 52 times superior to the cattle-to-badger rate (median: 0.042 transitions/lineage/year). Using the maximum clade credibility tree, we identified that over 75% of the lineages from 1989 to 2000 were present in badgers. In addition, we calculated a median of 64 transition events from badger-to-cattle (IQR: 10–91) and a median of zero transition event from cattle-to-badger (IQR: 0–3). Our model enabled us to infer inter-species transitions but not intra-population transmission as in previous epidemiological studies, where relevant units were farms and badger social groups. Thus, while we could not confirm badgers as possible intermediaries in farm-to-farm transmission, badger-to-cattle transition rate was high and we confirmed long-term presence of M. bovis in the badger population in the South-West of France.","2022-04-02","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:12:02","28","","1","53","","Vet.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature for methods combing epidemiological and genomic data in transmission tree reconstruction. We identified 22 methods from the 41 selected articles. We defined three families according to how genomic data was handled: a non-phylogenetic family, a sequential phylogenetic family, and a simultaneous phylogenetic family. We discussed methods according to the data needed as well as the underlying sequence mutation, within-host evolution, transmission, and case observation. In the non-phylogenetic family consisting of eight methods, pairwise genetic distances were estimated. In the phylogenetic families, transmission trees were inferred from phylogenetic trees either simultaneously (nine methods) or sequentially (five methods). While a majority of methods (17/22) modeled the transmission process, few (8/22) took into account imperfect case detection. Within-host evolution was generally (7/8) modeled as a coalescent process. These practical and theoretical considerations were highlighted in order to help select the appropriate method for an outbreak.","2022-02","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:13:48","2023-11-24 15:12:26","252","","2","11","","Pathogens","Methods Combining Genomic and Epidemiological Data in the Reconstruction of Transmission Trees","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","","genomic epidemiology; transmission tree; who-infected-whom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This association is sometimes attributed to events where transmissions occur at a disproportionately high rate, known as superspreading events. Here, we describe a sudden surge in new cases with the Omicron BA.1 strain amongst higher education students in Belgium. Contact tracers classed most of these cases as likely or possibly infected on New Year's Eve, indicating a direct trigger by New Year celebrations. Using a combination of contact tracing and phylogenetic data, we show the limited role of superspreading events in this surge. Finally, the numerous simultaneous transmissions allowed a unique opportunity to determine the distribution of incubation periods of the Omicron strain. Overall, our results indicate that, even under social restrictions, a surge in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when holiday celebrations result in small social gatherings attended simultaneously and communitywide.","2023-12-14","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:01:53","22195","","1","13","","Sci.

Using different wastewater collection points in Leuven, we wanted to investigate the use of wastewater surveillance as an early warning system for an uprise of infections and as a tool to follow the circulation of specific variants of concern (VOCs) in particular geographic areas. Wastewater samples were collected from local neighborhood sewers and from a large regional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the area of Leuven, Belgium. After virus concentration, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and normalized with the human fecal indicator pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). A combination of multiplex RT-qPCR assays was used to detect signature mutations of circulating VOCs. Fecal virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 variants was measured in feces samples of hospitalized patients. In two residential sampling sites, a rise in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentration preceded peaks in positive cases. In the WWTP, viral load peaks were seen concomitant with the consecutive waves of positive cases caused by the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and subsequent VOCs. During the Omicron BA.1 wave, the wastewater viral load increased to a lesser degree, even after normalization of SARS-CoV-2 concentration using PMMoV. This might be attributable to a lower level of fecal excretion of this variant. Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA1/BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 could be detected based on the presence of specific key mutations. The shift in variants was noticeable in the wastewater, with key mutations of two different variants being present simultaneously during the transition period. Wastewater-based surveillance is a sensitive tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 circulation levels and VOCs in larger regions. In times of reduced test capacity, this can prove to be highly valuable. Differences in excretion levels of various SARS-CoV-2 variants should however be taken into account when using wastewater surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 circulation levels in the population.","2023","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:05:53","2024-02-09 09:01:09","e28587","","2","95","","J.

Methods This prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from February 2020 to June 2022 in 5 countries, enrolling SARS-CoV-2 out- and in-patients followed at 3-, 6-, and 12-month from diagnosis, with assessment of clinical and biochemical features, antibody (Ab) response, Variant of Concern (VoC), and physical and mental quality of life (QoL). Outcome of interest was identification of risk and protective factors of PCS by clinical phenotype, setting, severity of disease, treatment, and vaccination status. We used SF-36 questionnaire to assess evolution in QoL index during follow-up and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (principal component analysis, PCA) to explore symptom clusters. Severity of PCS was defined by clinical phenotype and QoL. We also used generalized linear models to analyse the impact of PCS on QoL and associated risk and preventive factors.

PCA identified 4 clinical phenotypes: chronic fatigue-like syndrome (CFs: fatigue, headache and memory loss, 757 patients, 42%), respiratory syndrome (REs: cough and dyspnoea, 502, 23%); chronic pain syndrome (CPs: arthralgia and myalgia, 399, 22%); and neurosensorial syndrome (NSs: alteration in taste and smell, 197, 11%). Determinants of clinical phenotypes were different (all comparisons p < 0.05): being female increased risk of CPs, NSs, and CFs; chronic pulmonary diseases of REs; neurological symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of REs, NSs, and CFs; oxygen therapy of CFs and REs; and gastrointestinal symptoms at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis of CFs. Early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with monoclonal Ab (all clinical phenotypes), corticosteroids therapy for mild/severe cases (NSs), and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (CPs) were less likely to be associated to PCS (all comparisons p < 0.05). Highest reduction in QoL was detected in REs and CPs (43.57 and 43.86 vs 57.32 in PCS-negative controls, p < 0.001). Female sex (p < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.034) and renal complications (p = 0.002) during the acute infection were likely to increase risk of severe PCS (QoL <50). Vaccination and early treatment with monoclonal Ab reduced the risk of severe PCS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Interpretation Our study provides new evidence suggesting that PCS can be classified by clinical phenotypes with different impact on QoL, underlying possible different pathogenic mechanisms. We identified factors associated to each clinical phenotype and to severe PCS. These results might help in designing pathogenesis studies and in selecting high-risk patients for inclusion in therapeutic and management clinical trials.

Methods In this prospective, observational study (IDAMS), we included patients aged 5 years and older with undifferentiated fever at presentation from 26 outpatient facilities in eight countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, El Salvador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Viet Nam). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between clinical symptoms and laboratory tests with dengue versus other febrile illnesses between day 2 and day 5 after onset of fever (ie, illness days). We built a set of candidate regression models including clinical and laboratory variables to reflect the need of a comprehensive versus parsimonious approach. We assessed performance of these models via standard measures of diagnostic values. Findings Between Oct 18, 2011, and Aug 4, 2016, we recruited 7428 patients, of whom 2694 (36%) were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed dengue and 2495 (34%) with (non-dengue) other febrile illnesses and met inclusion criteria, and were included in the analysis. 2703 (52%) of 5189 included patients were younger than 15 years, 2486 (48%) were aged 15 years or older, 2179 (42%) were female and 3010 (58%) were male. Platelet count, white blood cell count, and the change in these variables from the previous day of illness had a strong association with dengue. Cough and rhinitis had strong associations with other febrile illnesses, whereas bleeding, anorexia, and skin flush were generally associated with dengue. Model performance increased between day 2 and 5 of illness. The comprehensive model (18 clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0·80 to 0·87 and specificities of 0·80 to 0·91, whereas the parsimonious model (eight clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0·80 to 0·88 and specificities of 0·81 to 0·89. A model that includes laboratory markers that are easy to measure (eg, platelet count or white blood cell count) outperformed the models based on clinical variables only. Interpretation Our results confirm the important role of platelet and white blood cell counts in diagnosing dengue, and the importance of serial measurements over subsequent days. We successfully quantified the performance of clinical and laboratory markers covering the early period of dengue. Resulting algorithms performed better than published schemes for distinction of dengue from other febrile illnesses, and take into account the dynamic changes over time. Our results provide crucial information needed for the update of guidelines, including the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness handbook. Funding EU's Seventh Framework Programme.

Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue virus spread is crucial for effective prevention of future outbreaks. By investigating these patterns, targeted dengue surveillance and control measures can be improved, aiding in the management of outbreaks in dengue-affected regions. Curaçao, where dengue is endemic, has experienced frequent outbreaks over the past 25 years. To examine the spatial and temporal trends of dengue outbreaks in Curaçao, this study employs an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach. Data on >6500 cases of dengue infections in Curaçao between the years 1995 and 2016 were used. Temporal and spatial statistics were applied. The Moran's I index identified the presence of spatial autocorrelation for incident locations, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness. The majority of cases were recorded in highly populated areas and a relationship was observed between population density and dengue cases. Temporal analysis demonstrated that cases mostly occurred from October to January, during the rainy season. Lower average temperatures, higher precipitation and a lower sea surface temperature appear to be related to an increase in dengue cases. This effect has a direct link to La Niña episodes, which is the cooling phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation. The spatial and temporal analyses conducted in this study are fundamental to understanding the timing and locations of outbreaks, and ultimately improving dengue outbreak management.","2024-02-01","2024-02-09 09:33:13","2024-02-09 09:33:13","2024-02-09 09:31:51","e00338","","","24","","Parasite Epidemiol.

However, the complexities of these systems make it challenging to determine the contributions these different species make to transmission. We experimentally manipulated transmission within a natural multihost–multipathogen–multivector system, by blocking flea-borne pathogen transmission from either of two co-occurring host species (bank voles and wood mice). Through genetic analysis of the resulting infections in the hosts and vectors, we show that both host species likely act together to maintain the overall flea community, but cross-species pathogen transmission is relatively rare—most pathogens were predominantly found in only one host species, and there were few cases where targeted treatment affected pathogens in the other host species. However, we do provide experimental evidence of some reservoir–spillover dynamics whereby reductions of some infections in one host species are achieved by blocking transmission from the other host species. Overall, despite the apparent complexity of such systems, we show there can be ‘covert simplicity’, whereby pathogen transmission is primarily dominated by single host species, potentially facilitating the targeting of key hosts for control, even in diverse ecological communities.","2023-11-15","2024-02-09 14:22:55","2024-02-09 14:22:55","2024-02-09 14:22:14","20231900","","2011","290","","Proc.
