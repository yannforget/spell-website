We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Zotero/storage/DQ83XWI5/Lambin et al. - 2010 - Pathogenic landscapes Interactions between land, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most populations are managed according to hunting schedules, some have been kept long-term in enclosures and other populations have been restocked with foreign deer. The red deer in the Brittany region of north-western France only occupy the largest forests in the region, reaching quite high densities in restricted areas. Here, we aimed to assess the extent of the genetic variability of the populations in four forest fragments and investigate their population genetic structure. We show that, despite relatively large expected heterozygosity values, these geographically isolated populations are genetically impoverished relative to individuals from large continuous forests in other parts of Western Europe. We provide evidence for population genetic structure with large genetic differentiation between geographically close populations, suggesting the absence of effective exchange between the forests. Using samples from the most likely source population, we show that at least two populations were non-indigenous. In order to limit further loss of genetic diversity, it should be a management objective to reduce isolation of the different forests, rather than further increase it by fences and hunting practices that could limit free movement of red deer.","2011","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:30:07","","1287-1297","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrative taxonomy aims to define stronger supported taxonomic hypotheses by considering complementary datasets from different characters. By following an integrative approach, the present study includes molecular, chemical and morphological criteria to establish the taxonomic status of two rare and doubtful cuckoo bumblebee taxa: Bombus (Psithyrus) barbutellus and Bombus (Psithyrus) maxillosus. These two sympatric taxa are discriminated by few morphological criteria (mainly wing darkness and hair length). We used these morphological character diagnoses to establish an a priori status of our samples (23 specimens). We developed a combined molecular dataset from one nuclear gene, elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), and one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), spanning 1623 bp, and a chemical dataset of sexual marking pheromones (73 compounds). The molecular data were subjected to maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference under partitioned model and maximum parsimony. The chemical data were analysed by clustering and the two-group k-means method to test divergences between the two species. The resulting phylogenetic trees show no consistent divergence between the two taxa. Moreover, we found no divergence in the sexual marking pheromones in the clustering and two-group k-means analyses. These converging results support the conspecificity of both taxa. Nonetheless, our determinations using the traditional morphological criteria separated our samples into two taxa. We conclude that the morphological criteria seem to relate to intraspecific variations: B. maxillosus is regarded as a syn.n. of B. barbutellus.","2011","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:35:12","","453-469","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization. © 2013 Lecocq et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2013","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:34:46","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Bumblebees Genetic differentiation Phylogeography Reproductive traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such as size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular differentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical communication has received very little attention to date. Here, we investigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species pairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that interact ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B. vestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of variation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland (European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, 3781 bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence for genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees exhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations. Likewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that Corsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from the mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS variability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led Corsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from their mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without a decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize that MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent lack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the preference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS. The impoverished Corsican bumblebee fauna has not led to relaxation of stabilizing selection on MMS but to consistent differentiation chemical reproductive traits on the island. © 2013 Lecocq et al.","2013","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:35:23","","","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying the historical biogeography and evolution of each major lineage within this group is a key step to understand the origin and early radiation of bees. Melitta is the largest genus of melittid bees, for which a robust molecular phylogeny and a biogeographic analysis are still lacking. Here, we derive a phylogenetic hypothesis from the sequences of seven independent DNA fragments of mitochondrial and nuclear origin. This phylogenetic hypothesis is then used to infer the evolution of the species range and of the host-plant shifts in Melitta. Our results confirmed the monophyly of Melitta, but did not recover all previously defined clades within the genus. We propose new taxa by splitting the genus in three subgenera (including two new subgenera described in the Appendix: Afromelitta subgen. nov., Plesiomelitta subgen. nov.) and describe two new species: Melitta avontuurensis sp. n. and M. richtersveldensis sp. n. Regarding the evolution of host-plant use, our analysis suggests that all species currently specialized on one plant family originated from an ancestor that was specialized on Fabaceae plants. The inferred biogeographic history for the genus supported an African origin. In concordance with previous studies identifying Africa as the geographic origin for many clades of bees, our data bring new evidence for an African origin of melittid bees. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","2014","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:31:03","","412-419","","1","70","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Africa Bee plant interaction Bees Historical biogeography Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on field records collected over the past two decades in Western Europe, we report on the rapid geographic range expansion in Colletes hederae, a solitary bee species. To characterize how this expansion shaped the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations, we performed a genetic analysis based on the sequencing of three nuclear loci (RNAp, CAD and WgL). We then simulated the evolution of DNA sequences under a spatially explicit model of coalescence to compare different hypotheses regarding the mode of colonization associated with this rapid expansion and to identify those that are most consistent with the observed molecular data. Our genetic analyses indicate that the range expansion was not associated with an important reduction in genetic diversity, even in the most recently colonized area in the United Kingdom. Moreover, little genetic differentiation was observed among populations. Our comparative analysis of simulated data sets indicates that the observed genetic data are more consistent with a demographic scenario involving relatively high migration rates than with a scenario based on a high reproduction rate associated with few migrants. In the light of these results, we discuss the factors that might have contributed to the rapid geographic range expansion of this pollen-specialist solitary bee species across Western Europe. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.","2014","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:31:58","","116-132","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Coalescence simulations Colletes Phylogeography Pollen specialization Range expansion Solitary bee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, in most empirical studies, relatively large portions of species ranges are often treated as panmictic populations, ignoring the underlying spatial context. In some cases, however, a more accurate spatial model is required. We use a spatially explicit model of coalescence (easily constructed by overlaying a two-dimensional grid on maps displaying an estimate of past and current species ranges) to evaluate the potential of several summary statistics to differentiate three typical phylogeographic scenarios. We first explore the variation of each summary statistic within the boundaries of each phylogeographic scenario, and identify those that appear most promising for a comparison of historical scenarios and/or to infer historical parameters. We then combine a selected set of summary statistics in a single chi-square statistic and evaluate whether it can be used to differentiate past geographic fragmentation or range expansion from a simple scenario of isolation by distance. We also investigate the benefits of using a spatially explicit model by comparing its performance to alternative models that are less spatially explicit (lower geographic resolution). The results identify conditions in which each summary statistic is useful to infer the evolution of a species range, and allow us to validate our spatially explicit model of coalescence and our procedure to compare simulated and observed sequence data. We also provide a detailed description of the spatially explicit model of coalescence used, which is currently lacking.","2014","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:32:42","","3359-3372","","12","31","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we compare the performance of barcode gap detection, haplowebs and generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) models to delineate chimpanzees and bonobos using nuclear sequence markers, then apply these single-locus species delimitation methods to data sets of one, three, or six species simulated under a wide range of population sizes, speciation rates, mutation rates and sampling efforts. Our results show that barcode gap detection and GMYC models are unable to delineate species properly in data sets composed of one or two species, two situations in which haplowebs outperform them. For data sets composed of three or six species, bGMYC and haplowebs outperform the single-threshold and multiple-threshold versions of GMYC, whereas a clear barcode gap is only observed when population sizes and speciation rates are both small. The latter conditions represent a ""sweet spot"" for molecular taxonomy where all the single-locus approaches tested work well; however, the performance of these methods decreases strongly when population sizes and speciation rates are high, suggesting that multilocus approaches may be necessary to tackle such cases. © The Author(s) 2015.

Genetic variation across the range of each species was explored by using sequence variation of a total of 368 specimens at one mitochondrial and two nuclear DNA fragments (total of 2380 bp). Comparing patterns of genetic variation across species allowed us to investigate whether diet specialization, relative range size and/or fragmentation, impact phylogeographic patterns in bumblebees. As expected, stronger fragmentations of the species range are associated with a stronger overall geographic differentiation. Furthermore, diet specialization appears to increase population structure at the landscape level, presumably due to the less widespread and more heterogeneously distributed food resources. Conversely, no clear association was highlighted between diet specialization or overall range size and genetic diversity. Surprisingly, the two generalist and co-distributed species investigated, B. pratorum and B. hortorum, displayed widely divergent patterns in terms of genetic diversity and population structure. We suggest these differences are best explained by contrasting responses to past climate changes, possibly involving different glacial refuges. Overall, our results are compatible with a combined impact of two interacting parameters on intraspecific genetic variation: environment disturbances (presumably related to past climate changes) and features specific to the organism, such as diet specialization. They thus further highlight the challenge of dissociating both parameters in phylogeographic studies. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","2015","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:32:10","","926-939","","4","116","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Bombus Floral specialization Genetic diversity Phytophagous insect Population structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, ecological factors also have the potential to influence demographic history and thus patterns of genetic variation. In this study, we investigated the impact of past climate, and also the potential impact of host plant species abundance, on intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed and related specialized solitary bees of the genus Melitta with very similar life history traits and dispersal capacities. We sequenced five independent loci in samples collected from the three species. Our analyses revealed that the species associated with the most abundant host plant species (Melitta leporina) displays unusually high genetic variation, to an extent that is seldom reported in phylogeographic studies of animals and plants. This suggests a potential role of food resource abundance in determining current patterns of genetic variation in specialized herbivorous insects. Patterns of genetic variation in the two other species indicated lower overall levels of diversity, and that M. nigricans could have experienced a recent range expansion. Ecological niche modelling of the three Melitta species and their main host plant species suggested a strong reduction in range size during the last glacial maximum. Comparing observed sequence data with data simulated using spatially explicit models of coalescence suggests that M. leporina recovered a range and population size close to their current levels at the end of the last glaciation, and confirms recent range expansion as the most likely scenario for M. nigricans. Overall, this study illustrates that both demographic history and ecological factors may have contributed to shape current phylogeographic patterns.","2015","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:32:53","","1074-1090","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","coalescent simulations demographic history food specialization intraspecific diversity phylogeography phytophagous insects population fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to quickly identify unknown sources and chains of transmission is key to ending the EVD epidemic and of even greater importance in the context of recent reports of Ebola virus (EBOV) persistence in survivors. Phylogenetic analysis of complete EBOV genomes can provide important information on the source of any new infection. A local deep sequencing facility was established at the Mateneh Ebola Treatment Centre in central Sierra Leone. The facility included all wetlab and computational resources to rapidly process EBOV diagnostic samples into full genome sequences. We produced 554 EBOV genomes from EVD cases across Sierra Leone. These genomes provided a detailed description of EBOV evolution and facilitated phylogenetic tracking of new EVD cases. Importantly, we show that linked genomic and epidemiological data can not only support contact tracing but also identify unconventional transmission chains involving body fluids, including semen. Rapid EBOV genome sequencing, when linked to epidemiological information and a comprehensive database of virus sequences across the outbreak, provided a powerful tool for public health epidemic control efforts.%U http://ve.oxfordjournals.org/content/vevolu/2/1/vew016.full.pdf","2016","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:29:18","","","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis demonstrated that Nova virus has a high prevalence and widespread distribution in Belgium. While Nova virus displayed relatively high nucleotide diversity in Belgium, amino acid changes were limited. The nucleocapsid protein was subjected to strong purifying selection, reflecting the strict evolutionary constraints placed upon Nova virus by its host. Spatio-temporal analysis using Bayesian evolutionary inference techniques demonstrated that Nova virus had efficiently spread in the European mole population in Belgium, forming two distinct clades, representing east and west of Belgium. The influence of landscape barriers, in the form of the main waterways, on the dispersal velocity of Nova virus was assessed using an analytical framework for comparing Bayesian viral phylogenies with environmental landscape data. We demonstrated that waterways did not act as an environmental resistance factor slowing down Nova virus diffusion in the mole population.

A key question in rabies epidemiology is the identification of factors that impact virus dispersion. Here we apply new analytical methods, based on phylogeographic reconstructions of viral lineage movement, to undertake a comparative evolutionary-epidemiological study of the spatial dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) epidemics in different hosts and habitats. We compiled RABV data sets from skunk, raccoon, bat and domestic dog populations in order to investigate the viral diffusivity of different RABV epidemics, and to detect and compare the environmental factors that impact the velocity of viral spread in continuous spatial landscapes. We build on a recently developed statistical framework that uses spatially- and temporally-referenced phylogenies. We estimate several spatial statistics of virus spread, which reveal a higher diffusivity of RABV in domestic dogs compared with RABV in other mammals. This finding is explained by subsequent analyses of environmental heterogeneity, which indicate that factors relating to human geography play a significant role in RABV dispersion in domestic dogs. More generally, our results suggest that human-related factors are important worldwide in explaining RABV dispersion in terrestrial host species. Our study shows that phylogenetically informed viral movements can be used to elucidate the factors that impact virus dispersal, opening new opportunities for a better understanding of the impact of host species and environmental conditions on the spatial dynamics of rapidly evolving populations.","2017","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:33:04","","2563-2571","","10","34","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The degree of connectivity implies using alternative conservation prioritizations based on the appropriate spatial scale for management units. In species with low population connectivity, it is important to preserve local populations in order to maintain the species throughout its range. In contrast, species with high connectivity require extensive management aiming at preserving gene flow through the entire species range. Here we examine at the continental scale the relationship between inter-population/inter-individual genetic and geographical distances to study the isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern within the European range of nine wild bee species. We then assess the suitability of multi-local or extensive conservation to ensure their long-term survival. Results based on inter-population differences show only two out of nine species with significant IBD. European bee populations seem quite connected when their IBD is compared to IBD of other phyla. However, our results based on inter-individual distances show that eight out of nine species display significant IBD. These different results are presumably a consequence of potential limitations of the inter-population approach. Therefore, we speculate that the inter-population approach could result in inaccurate IBD estimations. This approach should therefore be replaced by the inter-individual approach in order to provide strong supported conservation guidelines. We support multi-local conservation programs based on our analysis of inter-individual distances.","2017","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:35:42","","585-596","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, the debate has mostly focused on plants, with little consideration for other groups of organisms, e.g. the numerous plant-dependent insect species. Here, we study the late-Quaternary evolution of the European range of a boreo-montane leaf beetle, Gonioctena intermedia, which feeds exclusively on the boreal and temperate trees Prunus padus and Sorbus aucuparia. Using species distribution models, we estimated the congruence between areas of past and present suitable climate for this beetle and its host plants. Then we derived historical hypotheses from the congruent range estimates, and evaluated their compatibility with observed DNA sequence variation at five independent loci. We investigated compatibility using computer simulations of population evolution under various coalescence models. We find strong evidence for range modifications in response to late-Quaternary climate changes, and support for the presence of populations of G. intermedia in northern Europe since the beginning of the last glaciation. The presence of a co-dependent insect in the region through the LGM provides new evidence supporting the glacial survival of cold-tolerant tree species in northern Europe.%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/284/1856/20162799.full.pdf","2017","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:36:11","","","","1856","284","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two subtypes have been defined (EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b), each associated with a different geographical distribution. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive sequence analysis based on 80 newly obtained EBLV-1 nearly complete genome sequences from nine European countries over a 45-year period to infer selection pressures, rates of nucleotide substitution, and evolutionary time scale of these two subtypes in Europe. Our results suggest that the current lineage of EBLV-1 arose in Europe ∼600 years ago and the virus has evolved at an estimated average substitution rate of ∼4.19×10−5 subs/site/year, which is among the lowest recorded for RNA viruses. In parallel, we investigate the genetic structure of French serotine bats at both the nuclear and mitochondrial level and find that they constitute a single genetic cluster. Furthermore, Mantel tests based on interindividual distances reveal the absence of correlation between genetic distances estimated between viruses and between host individuals. Taken together, this indicates that the genetic diversity observed in our E. serotinus samples does not account for EBLV-1a and -1b segregation and dispersal in Europe.","2017","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:36:23","","3202-3213","","11","9","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we address this issue using a collection of phylodynamic approaches. We show that long-distance dispersal events were not crucial for epidemic expansion and that preventing viral lineage movement to any given administrative area would, in most cases, have had little impact. However, major urban areas were critical in attracting and disseminating the virus: preventing viral lineage movement to all three capitals simultaneously would have contained epidemic size to one-third. We also show that announcements of border closures were followed by a significant but transient effect on international virus dispersal. By quantifying the hypothetical impact of different intervention strategies, as well as the impact of barriers on dispersal frequency, our study illustrates how phylodynamic analyses can help to address specific epidemiological and outbreak control questions.","2018","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:32:22","","2222","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although multilocus approaches are gaining fast in popularity, single-gene methods still predominate in the literature. However, available simulation benchmarks of these methods focus exclusively on species-poor samples and/or tree-based approaches: as a result, travellers in the land of single-locus species delimitation lack a comprehensive “hitchhiker's guide” highlighting the sweet spots and dangers on their road. To fill this gap, we compared the performances of distance-based (ABGD, “automatic barcode gap discovery”), allele sharing-based (haplowebs) and tree-based approaches (GMYC, “generalized mixed Yule-coalescent” and PTP, “Poisson tree processes”) to detect interspecific boundaries in samples of 6, 60 and 120 simulated species with various speciation rates, effective population sizes, mutation rates and sampling patterns. We found that all approaches performed poorly when population sizes and speciation rates were large, with haplowebs yielding best results followed by ABGD then tree-based approaches. The latter's error type was mostly oversplitting, whereas ABGD chiefly overlumped and haplowebs leaned either way depending on simulation parameters: such widely divergent error patterns suggest that, if all three types of methods agree, then the resulting delimitation is probably correct. Perfect congruence being quite rare, travellers in search of a one-size-fit-all approach to single-locus species delimitation should forget it; however, our hitchhiker's guide raises hope that such species delimitation's Holy Grail may be found in the relatively uncharted nearby land of multilocus species delimitation.","2018","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:32:31","","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a discrete phylogeographic approach can be used to test predictors of transition rates among discrete locations, alternative continuous phylogeographic reconstructions can also be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal velocity of a virus. The two approaches are complementary tools for studying pathogens' spread, but in both cases, care must be taken to avoid misinterpretations. Here, we analyse rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) sequence data from West and East Africa to illustrate how both approaches can be used to study the impact of environmental factors on the virus’ dispersal frequency and velocity. While it was previously reported that host connectivity was a major determinant of RYMV spread, we show that this was a false positive result due to the lack of appropriate negative controls. We also discuss and compare the phylodynamic tools currently available for investigating the impact of environmental factors on virus spread.","2018","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:33:26","","vey023-vey023","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated and summarized the literature on emerging HPAI H5 and H7 viruses with the aim of building a spatio-temporal database of all these recorded conversions and reassortments events. We subsequently mapped the spatio-temporal distribution of known emergence events, as well as the species and production systems that they were associated with, the aim being to establish their main characteristics. From 1959 onwards, we identified a total of 41 independent H7 and H5 LPAI to HPAI conversion events. All but two of these events were reported in commercial poultry production systems, and a majority of these events took place in high-income countries. In contrast, a total of 125 reassortments have been reported from 1983 to 2015, which predominantly took place in countries with poultry production systems transitioning from backyard to intensive production systems. Those systems are characterized by several co-circulating viruses, multiple host species, regular contact points in live bird markets, limited biosecurity within value chains, and frequent vaccination campaigns that impose selection pressures for emergence of novel reassortants. We conclude that novel HPAI emergences by these two mechanisms occur in different ecological niches, with different viral, environmental and host associated factors, which has implications in early detection and management and mitigation of the risk of emergence of novel HPAI viruses.","2018","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:33:38","","","","84","5","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Low pathogenic to highly pathogenic conversion; Novel HPAI emergences; phylogeography.; Reassortment; spatialand temporal pattern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2016, there has been a resurgence of cases in Africa and South America—and this at a time when the vaccine is in short supply. The worry is that yellow fever will spread from the forests to the cities, because its vector, Aedes spp. mosquitoes, are globally ubiquitous. Faria et al. integrate genomic, epidemiological, and case distribution data from Brazil to estimate patterns of geographic spread, the risks of virus exposure, and the contributions of rural versus urban transmission (see the Perspective by Barrett). Currently, the yellow fever epidemic in Brazil seems to be driven by infections acquired while visiting forested areas and indicates spillover from susceptible wild primates.Science, this issue p. 894; see also p. 847The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian Aedes species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.","2018","2018-10-02 12:05:03","2018-10-03 08:34:05","","894-899","","6405","361","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
