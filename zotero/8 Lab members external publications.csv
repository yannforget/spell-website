We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/DQ83XWI5/Lambin et al. - 2010 - Pathogenic landscapes Interactions between land, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This diversity is unevenly distributed across the species range, delimiting genetic diversity hotspots (GDH). Focusing conservation efforts on regions where GDH of several species overlap (i.e., multispecies GDH) could rationalize conservation efforts by protecting several taxa in one go. However, recent studies suggest the existence of many species-specific GDH. This would make spatially prioritizing protection even more challenging as it requires the integration of these multiple GDH rather than few hotspots into conservation planning. Here, we characterize GDH of nine co-distributed bee species through an original comparative mapping approach to assess the suitability of a spatial prioritization strategy to protect their genetic diversity. Location We studied bee populations from Europe. Methods First, we used a sliding window approach to estimate the nucleotide diversity and its geographic distribution to highlight GDH of each species. Second, we assessed the overlap of GDH between species by generating consensus maps based on the species-specific maps of nucleotide diversity. Third, we used the GDH distribution patterns to identify the extent of cost-effective area network that would be needed to protect genetic diversity of all nine species. Results Genetic diversity was unevenly distributed across species ranges, but we found no evidence of a large overlap among GDH from all species. Cost-effective area network needed to protect genetic diversity of all species spreads over several large geographic areas including regions under high human development pressures. Main conclusions Genetic diversity hotspots' location is species-specific. Therefore, focusing conservation efforts strictly on the few regions harbouring GDH for many bee species is unlikely to be sufficient to ensure long-term persistence of all species.

Endemic pathogens that infect an individual in the ﬁrst years of life, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating or ameliorating morbidity and mortality. Pathogen associations are ubiquitous but poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. We report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found signiﬁcant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identiﬁed both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens. Our results provide novel insights on the complex associations underlying pathogen co-occurrence networks.","2019-03-12","2019-03-15 15:29:29","2019-03-15 15:29:30","2019-03-15 15:29:29","","","","","","","Endemic infection can shape exposure to novel pathogens","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/FZFGE2IN/Fountain-Jones et al. - 2019 - Endemic infection can shape exposure to novel path.pdf","","","","Ezenwa, Vanessa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the potential teratogenic effects of Wēnzhōu infection on the development of a Murid rodent, Rattus exulans. Using direct virus detection, morphological records and comparative analyses, a link was demonstrated between host infection status and host morphologies (the spleen irrespective of weight, the skull shape and the cranial cavity volume) at the level of the individual (females only). This study demonstrates that mammarenavirus infections can impact natural host physiology and/or affect developmental processes. The presence of an infecting micro-parasite during the development of the rat may lead to a physiological trade-off between immunity and brain size. Alternatively, replication of virus in specialized organs can result in selective morphologic abnormalities and lesions.","2017-05","2018-03-20 10:48:40","2018-03-20 10:48:41","2018-03-20 10:48:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/TQHXRH3V/Artois et al. - 2017 - Effects of mammarenavirus infection (Wēnzhōu virus.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.","2017-10-11","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2018-11-07 13:34:07","20170919","","1864","284","","Proc.

This study integrated parasitological and ancient DNA methods with a large sample set dating between Neolithic and Early Modern periods to explore the utility of molecular archaeoparasitology as a new approach to study the past. Molecular analyses provided unequivocal species-level parasite identification and revealed location-specific epidemiological signatures. Faecal–oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were ubiquitous across time and space. By contrast, high numbers of food-associated cestodes (Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata) were restricted to medieval Lübeck. The presence of these cestodes and changes in their prevalence at approximately 1300 CE indicate substantial alterations in diet or parasite availability. Trichuris trichiura ITS-1 sequences grouped into two clades; one ubiquitous and one restricted to medieval Lübeck and Bristol. The high sequence diversity of T.t.ITS-1 detected in Lübeck is consistent with its importance as a Hanseatic trading centre. Collectively, these results introduce molecular archaeoparasitology as an artefact-independent source of historical evidence.","2018","2018-10-06 18:36:13","2018-10-06 18:36:13","","","","1888","285","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The found relationships led us to pursue a third goal: (3) use temporal dynamics in woody cover to estimate potential woody cover. Location Sub-Saharan African savannas. Methods The study used very high spatial resolution satellite imagery at sites with overlapping older (2002–2006) and newer (2011–2016) imagery to estimate change in woody cover. We sampled 596 sites in 38 separate areas across African savannas. Areas with high anthropogenic impact were avoided in order to more clearly identify the influence of environmental factors. Relationships between woody cover change and potential drivers were identified using linear regression and simultaneous autoregression, where the latter accounts for spatial autocorrelation. Results The mean annual change in woody cover across our study areas was 0.25% per year. Although we cannot explain the general trend of encroachment based on our data, we found that change rates were positively correlated with the difference between potential woody cover and actual woody cover (a proxy for water availability; p < .001), and negatively correlated with fire frequency (p < .01). Using the relationship between rates of encroachment and initial cover, we estimated potential woody cover at different rainfall levels. Main conclusions The results indicate that woody encroachment is ongoing and widespread across African savannas. The fact that the difference between potential and actual cover was the most significant predictor highlights the central role of water availability and tree–tree competition in controlling change in woody populations, both in water-limited and mesic savannas. Our approach to derive potential woody cover from the woody cover change trajectories demonstrates that temporal dynamics in woody populations can be used to infer resource limitations.","2018","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","2019-01-16 14:18:07","1209-1218","","6","45","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors.

We anticipate that woody canopy cover, crown density, crown size, and the level of spatial aggregation among woody plants in the landscape will vary across environmental gradients. A high level of woody plant aggregation is most distinct in periodic vegetation patterns (PVPs), which emerge as a result of ecohydrological processes such as runoff generation and increased infiltration close to plants. Similar, albeit weaker, forces may influence the spatial distribution of woody plants elsewhere in savannas. Exploring these trends can extend our knowledge of how semi-arid vegetation structure is constrained by rainfall regime, soil type, topography, and disturbance processes such as fire. Using high-spatial-resolution imagery, a flexible classification framework, and a crown delineation method, we extracted woody vegetation properties from 876 sites spread over African savannas. At each site, we estimated woody cover, mean crown size, crown density, and the degree of aggregation among woody plants. This enabled us to elucidate the effects of rainfall regimes (MAP and seasonality), soil texture, slope, and fire frequency on woody vegetation properties. We found that previously documented increases in woody cover with rainfall is more consistently a result of increasing crown size than increasing density of woody plants. Along a gradient of mean annual precipitation from the driest (&lt;<span class=""thinspace""></span>200<span class=""thinspace""></span>mm<span class=""thinspace""></span>yr<sup>−1</sup>) to the wettest (1200–1400<span class=""thinspace""></span>mm<span class=""thinspace""></span>yr<sup>−1</sup>) end, mean estimates of crown size, crown density, and woody cover increased by 233, 73, and 491<span class=""thinspace""></span>% respectively. We also found a unimodal relationship between mean crown size and sand content suggesting that maximal savanna tree sizes do not occur in either coarse sands or heavy clays. When examining the occurrence of PVPs, we found that the same factors that contribute to the formation of PVPs also correlate with higher levels of woody plant aggregation elsewhere in savannas and that rainfall seasonality plays a key role for the underlying processes.</p>","2017-07-10","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","2019-01-16 14:17:33","3239-3252","","13","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.biogeosciences.net","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/7JIIT78H/2017.html; /Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/EITALYGF/Axelsson and Hanan - 2017 - Patterns in woody vegetation structure across Afri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiological agents are spirochete bacteria that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.) complex and are transmitted by hard ticks among a large range of vertebrate hosts. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector. In the absence of a vaccine and given the current difficulties to diagnose and treat chronic Lyme syndromes, there is urgent need for prevention. In this context, accurate information on the spatial patterns of risk of exposure to ticks is of prime importance for public health. The objective of our study was to provide a snapshot map of the risk of human infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. pathogens in a periurban forest at a high resolution, and to analyze the factors that contribute to variation in this risk. Field monitoring took place over three weeks in May 2011 in the suburban Sénart forest (3,200ha; southeast of Paris), which receives over 3 million people annually. We sampled ticks over the entire forest area (from 220 forest stands with a total area of 35,200m(2)) and quantified the density of questing nymphs (DON), the prevalence of infection among nymphs (NIP), and the density of infected nymphs (DIN), which is the most important predictor of the human risk of Lyme borreliosis. For each of these response variables, we explored the relative roles of weather (saturation deficit), hosts (abundance indices of ungulates and Tamias sibiricus, an introduced rodent species), vegetation and forest cover, superficial soil composition, and the distance to forest roads. In total, 19,546 questing nymphs were collected and the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. was tested in 3,903 nymphs by qPCR. The mean DON was 5.6 nymphs per 10m(2) (standard deviation=10.4) with an average NIP of 10.1% (standard deviation=0.11). The highest DIN was 8.9 infected nymphs per 10m(2), with a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation=0.6). Our mapping and modeling revealed a strong heterogeneity of risk within the forest. The highest risk was found in the eastern part of the forest and localized patches in the northwestern part. Lyme borreliosis risk was positively associated with stands of deciduous trees (mainly oaks) and roe deer abundance. Contrary to expectations, DIN actually increased with distance from the point of introduction of T. sibiricus (i.e., DIN was higher in areas with potentially lower abundances of T. sibiricus). Thus, despite the fact that T. sibiricus is an important reservoir host for B. burgdorferi s. l., our study found that other explanatory factors played a more important role in determining the density of infected ticks. Precise mapping of the risk of exposure to Lyme borreliosis in a highly visited forest represents an important tool for targeting prevention and control measures, as well as making the general public and local health officials aware of the risks.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:19","2019-01-16 13:40:19","","644-652","","5","7","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26897396","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897396","","Animals; Humans; Population Density; Ixodes ricinus; Forests; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Acarological risk map; Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Paris; Risk Assessment; Sciuridae; Tick density; Tick infection prevalence; Ticks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disentangling transmission patterns in such systems is often challenging, yet investigating how different host species contribute to transmission is crucial to properly assess and manage disease risk. We aim to reveal transmission cycles of bacteria within the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, which include Lyme disease agents. We characterized Borrelia genotypes found in 488 infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs collected in the Sénart Forest located near Paris (France). These genotypes were compared to those observed in three sympatric species of small mammals and network analyses reveal four independent transmission cycles. Statistical modelling shows that two cycles involving chipmunks, an introduced species, and non-sampled host species such as birds, are responsible for the majority of tick infections. In contrast, the cycle involving native bank voles only accounts for a small proportion of infected ticks. Genotypes associated with the two primary transmission cycles were isolated from Lyme disease patients, confirming the epidemiological threat posed by these strains. Our work demonstrates that combining high-throughput sequence typing with networks tools and statistical modeling is a promising approach for characterizing transmission cycles of multi-host pathogens in complex ecological settings.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:06","2019-01-16 13:40:06","","31273","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27498685 PMCID: PMC4976386","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/A2CK4W9U/Jacquot et al. - 2016 - Multiple independent transmission cycles of a tick.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27498685","","Phylogeny; Animals; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Humans; Zoonoses; Ecology; Forests; Birds; Disease Reservoirs; Genotype; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; France; Introduced Species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features make the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex an attractive biological model that can be used to study the diversification and the epidemiology of endemic bacterial pathogens. We investigated the potential of population genomic approaches to study these processes. Sixty-three strains belonging to three species within the Borrelia burgdorferi complex were isolated from questing ticks in Alsace (France), a region where Lyme disease is highly endemic. We first aimed to characterize the degree of genetic isolation among the species sampled. Phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses revealed clear delineations: there was a ∼50 fold difference between intra-specific and inter-specific recombination rates. We then investigated whether the population genomic data contained information of epidemiological relevance. In phylogenies inferred using most of the genome, conspecific strains did not cluster in clades. These results raise questions about the relevance of different strategies when investigating pathogen epidemiology. For instance, here, both classical analytic approaches and phylodynamic simulations suggested that population sizes and migration rates were higher in B. garinii populations, which are normally associated with birds, than in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations. The phylogenetic analyses of the infection-related ospC gene and its flanking region provided additional support for this finding. Traces of recombination among the B. burgdorferi s.s. lineages and lineages associated with small mammals were found, suggesting that they shared the same hosts. Altogether, these results provide baseline evidence that can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the host range of B. burgdorferi lineages based on population genomic data.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:51","2019-01-16 13:39:51","","e94384","","4","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24721934 PMCID: PMC3993988","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/ZFAE5X47/Jacquot et al. - 2014 - Comparative population genomics of the Borrelia bu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721934","","Phylogeny; Genetic Variation; Animals; Humans; Host Specificity; Birds; Mammals; Disease Vectors; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Lyme Disease; Ticks; France; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Genome, Bacterial; Metagenomics; Reproductive Isolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These pathogens are transmitted by ticks and infect multiple, taxonomically distinct, host species. From an epidemiological perspective, it is important to determine whether genetic variants within the species complex are able to spread freely through the whole host community or, instead, if certain variants are restricted to particular hosts. To this end, we characterized the genotypes of members of the B. burgdorferi species complex; the bacteria were isolated from more than two hundred individuals captured in the wild and belonging to three different rodent host species. For each individual, we used a high-throughput approach to amplify and sequence rplB, a housekeeping gene, and ospC, which is involved in infection. This approach allowed us to evaluate the genetic diversity both within and among species in the B. burgdorferi species complex. Strong evidence of genetic differentiation among host species was revealed by both genes, even though they are, a priori, not constrained by the same selective pressures. These data are discussed in the context of the advancements made possible by multi-locus high-throughput sequencing and current knowledge of Lyme disease epidemiology.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:30","2019-01-16 13:39:30","","e88581","","2","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24533116 PMCID: PMC3922933","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/2IBXSGNS/Jacquot et al. - 2014 - High-throughput sequence typing reveals genetic di.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533116","","Phylogeny; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Genetic Variation; Algorithms; Animals; Host Specificity; Sequence Alignment; Mice; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Genotype; Sciuridae; Borrelia burgdorferi; Antigens, Bacterial; Arvicolinae; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we apply both phylodynamic and phylogenetic community ecology techniques to examine the consequences of pathogen heterogeneity on transmission by assessing subtype-specific transmission pathways in a social carnivore. We use comprehensive social and spatial network data to examine transmission pathways for three subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle ) in African lions (Panthera leo) at multiple scales in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used FIVPle molecular data to examine the role of social organization and lion density in shaping transmission pathways and tested to what extent vertical (i.e., father- and/or mother-offspring relationships) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) transmission underpinned these patterns for each subtype. Using the same data, we constructed subtype-specific FIVPle co-occurrence networks and assessed what combination of social networks, spatial networks or co-infection best structured the FIVPle network. While social organization (i.e., pride) was an important component of FIVPle transmission pathways at all scales, we find that FIVPle subtypes exhibited different transmission pathways at within- and between-pride scales. A combination of social and spatial networks, coupled with consideration of subtype co-infection, was likely to be important for FIVPle transmission for the two major subtypes, but the relative contribution of each factor was strongly subtype-specific. Our study provides evidence that pathogen heterogeneity is important in understanding pathogen transmission, which could have consequences for how endemic pathogens are managed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community phylogenetic ecology coupled with phylodynamic techniques can reveal insights into the differential evolutionary pressures acting on virus subtypes, which can manifest into landscape-level effects.","2017","2019-01-16 13:38:25","2019-01-16 13:38:25","","1469-1482","","6","86","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28884827","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/VBI6BA4Y/Fountain-Jones et al. - 2017 - Linking social and spatial networks to viral commu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884827","","Phylogeny; Animals; community ecology; Coinfection; feline immunodeficiency virus; generalized dissimilarity modelling; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; landscape ecology; Lentivirus Infections; Lions; OTU networks; phylogenetic diversity; Social Behavior; social systems; Tanzania; transmission mode; wildlife disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four spatially explicit local scenarios are built each including a narrative, two future land cover maps up to 2040 and 2100, and a set of quantified LULCC. Scenarios are then used to identify areas likely to encounter land cover changes (deforestation, reforestation, and encroachment) prone to affect gravitational hazards. In order to demonstrate their interest for decision-making, future land cover maps are used as input to a landslide hazard assessment model. Results highlight that reforestation will continue to be a major trend in all scenarios and confirm that the approach improves the accuracy of landslide hazard computations.

Within triatomines, several Rhodnius species have been found inhabiting palms, and certain factors such as palm species and location have been related to the abundance and T. cruzi infection of those insects in palms. In this study, the main goal was to determine if R. prolixus abundances and infection rates in Attalea butyracea and Elaeis guineensis palms are related to ecological factors such as palm species, crown microclimate, and available blood meal sources. Triatomine sampling was performed in two municipalities of Casanare, Colombia, specifically in the intersection of riparian forests and oil palm plantations. For R. prolixus abundance per palm, the predictors showing more relationship were palm species and blood meal species identified in the palm, and for T. cruzi infection per triatomine, they were palm species and nymphal stage. Palm microclimate was very similar in both palm species and did not show a relationship with triatomine abundance. Comparing palm species, A. butyracea showed more blood meal species, including more refractory host species, than E. guineensis, but lower T. cruzi infection rate and parasitaemia. Interestingly, non-arboreal blood meal species were frequently found in the analyzed nymphs, indicating that the blood source for R. prolixus in palms corresponded to all the fauna located in the surrounded landscape and not only in the palm. These results could expose a new ecological scenario to interpret the T. cruzi transmission in sylvatic environments.","2020-12-01","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:15:15","105674","","","212","","Acta Trop.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/9CA4KAXF/Calderón et al. - 2020 - How microclimatic variables and blood meal sources.pdf","","","Chagas disease; Cleptohematophagy; Disease ecology; Habitat selection; Triatomines; Vector ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The parasite is transmitted by triatomine insects, of which some species are often associated with palms. The establishment of oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis) in the Orinoco region (Colombia) has been rapidly growing, possibly constituting a new environment for the establishment and increase in triatomine populations. In this study, the potential of Rhodnius prolixus to colonize E. guineensis plantations and maintain T. cruzi transmission was assessed. Fieldwork was conducted in two areas located in the department of Casanare for sampling E. guineensis and Attalea butyracea palms, sampling for triatomines to determine their abundance and prevalence of T. cruzi infection. To assess T. cruzi transmission potential in the area, sylvatic and domestic mammals were sampled. Results showed that palm infestation with triatomines was higher in A. butyracea than in E. guineensis palms and T. cruzi infection in triatomines varied between habitats for one study area, but was constant in the other site. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mammals in the E. guineensis plantations were mainly generalist rodents, suggesting that these mammals could have an important role in T. cruzi transmission in plantations. In conclusion, E. guineensis plantations in the Orinoco region are suitable habitats for R. prolixus and T. cruzi transmission.","2020-07","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","","428-436","","1","103","","Am.

Nonetheless, identifying routes of disease transmission within a population, and determining the key groups of individuals that drive parasite transmission and maintenance, are fundamental to understanding disease dynamics. Gammaherpesviruses are a widespread group of DNA viruses that infect many vertebrate species, and murine gammaherpesviruses (i.e. MuHV-4) are a standard lab model for studying human herpesviruses, for which much about the pathology and immune response elicited to infection is well understood. However, despite this extensive research effort, primarily in the lab, the transmission route of murine gammaherpesviruses within their natural host populations is not well understood. Here, we aimed to understand wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV) transmission, by fitting a series of population dynamic models to field data on wood mice naturally infected with WMHV and then estimating transmission parameters within and between demographic groups of the host population. Different models accounted for different combinations of host sex (male/female), age (subadult/adult) and transmission functions (density/frequency-dependent). We found that a density-dependent transmission model incorporating explicit sex groups fitted the data better than all other proposed models. Male-to-male transmission was the highest among all possible combinations of between- and within-sex transmission classes, suggesting that male behaviour is a key factor driving WMHV transmission. Our models also suggest that transmission between sexes, although important, wasn’t symmetrical, with infected males playing a significant role in infecting naïve females but not vice versa. Overall this work shows the power of coupling population dynamic models with long-term field data to elucidate otherwise unobservable transmission processes in wild disease systems.","2021-06-01","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:13:19","100451","","","35","","Epidemics","Who acquires infection from whom?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/simondellicour/Dropbox/Simon_repos/Files/Zotero/storage/KGCC8IE2/Erazo et al. - 2021 - Who acquires infection from whom Estimating herpe.pdf","","","Disease ecology; Disease transmission; Host classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many factors have contributed to shifts in the disease distribution and eco epidemiological outcomes, resulting in the emergence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreaks and the incrimination of vectors in unreported regions. New research development is vital for establishing the new paradigms of the present transmission cycles, hoping to facilitate new control strategies to reduce parasite transmission. Hereafter, this work aims to model and infer the current transmission cycles of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia defined by vector and mammal species distributed and interacting in the different regions and validate them by performing sand fly and mammal collections. Vector-host co-occurrences were computed considering five ecoregions of the Colombian territory defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and downloaded from The Nature Conservancy TNC Maps website. Four validation sites were selected based on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis prevalence reports. Sand flies and mammals captured in the field were processed, and species were defined using conventional taxonomic guidelines. Detection of infection by Leishmania was performed to identify transmission cycles in the selected areas. This study uses predictive models based on available information from international gazetteers and fieldwork to confirm sand fly and mammalian species' sustaining Leishmania transmission cycles. Our results show an uneven distribution of mammal samples in Colombia, possibly due to sampling bias, since only two departments contributed 50% of the available samples. Bats were the vertebrates with the highest score values, suggesting substantial spatial overlap with sand flies than the rest of the vertebrates evaluated. Fieldwork allowed identifying three circulating Leishmania species, isolated from three sand fly species. In the Montane Forest ecosystem, one small marsupial, Gracilinanus marica, was found infected with Leishmania panamensis, constituting the first record of this species infected with Leishmania. In the same locality, an infected sand fly, Pintomyia pia, was found. The overall results could support the understanding of the current transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Colombia.","2021-03-24","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:14:17","6789","","1","11","","Sci.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the population densities and relative abundance of triatomines and mammals that may be involved in the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease to clarify the epidemiological scenario in an endemic area in the province of Casanare. Insect vectors on Attalea butyracea palms were captured using both manual searches and bait traps. The capture of mammals was performed using Sherman and Tomahawk traps. We report an infestation index of 88.5% in 148 palms and an index of T. cruzi natural infection of 60.2% in 269 dissected insects and 11.9% in 160 captured mammals. High population densities of triatomines were observed in the sylvatic environment and there was a high relative abundance of reservoirs in the area, suggesting a stable enzootic cycle.

While DVGs have been described for most viruses, identifying which, if any, can be used as therapeutic agents remains a challenge. We present a combined experimental evolution and computational approach to triage DVG sequence space and pinpoint the fittest deletions, using Zika virus as an arbovirus model. This approach identifies fit DVGs that optimally interfere with wild-type virus infection. We show that the most fit DVGs conserve the open reading frame to maintain the translation of the remaining non-structural proteins, a characteristic that is fundamental across the flavivirus genus. Finally, we demonstrate that the high fitness DVG is antiviral in vivo both in the mammalian host and the mosquito vector, reducing transmission in the latter by up to 90%. Our approach establishes the method to interrogate the DVG fitness landscape, and enables the systematic identification of DVGs that show promise as human therapeutics and vector control strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission and disease.","2021-04-16","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:20:59","2021-06-14 12:12:56","2290","","1","12","","Nat.
