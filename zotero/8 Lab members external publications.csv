This review aimed to identify common risk factors amongst spatial modelling studies conducted in these different agro-ecological systems, and to identify gaps in our understanding of the disease's spatial epidemiology. Three types of variables with similar statistical association with HPAI H5N1 presence across studies and regions were identified: domestic waterfowl, several anthropogenic variables (human population density, distance to roads) and indicators of water presence. Variables on socio-economic conditions, poultry trade, wild bird distribution and movements were comparatively rarely considered.

Using newly assembled data sets of the locations of 8,943 live-poultry markets in China and maps of environmental correlates, we develop a statistical model that accurately predicts the risk of H7N9 market infection across Asia. Local density of live-poultry markets is the most important predictor of H7N9 infection risk in markets, underscoring their key role in the spatial epidemiology of H7N9, alongside other poultry, land cover and anthropogenic predictor variables.

In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.","2008-03-25","2015-09-23 09:00:49","2015-09-23 09:00:49","2015-09-23 09:00:49","4769-4774","","12","105","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 18362346","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/42G4TT4V/Gilbert et al. - 2008 - Mapping H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza ris.pdf","","KEY4; H5N1; livestock-diseases","Epidemiology; animal husbandry; spatial modeling; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results demonstrate a strong association between H5N1 virus in Thailand and abundance of free-grazing ducks and, to a lesser extent, native chickens, cocks, wetlands, and humans.

Hence, the ecological determinants associated with risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI-H5N1) outbreaks are expected to differ between Bangladesh and e.g., Thailand and Vietnam. The primary aim of the current study was to establish ecological determinants associated with the risk of HPAI-H5N1 outbreaks at subdistrict level in Bangladesh. The secondary aim was to explore the performance of two different statistical modeling approaches for unmeasured spatially correlated variation. Methodology/Principal Findings An ecological study at subdistrict level in Bangladesh was performed with 138 subdistricts with HPAI-H5N1 outbreaks during 2007–2008, and 326 subdistricts with no outbreaks. The association between ecological determinants and HPAI-H5N1 outbreaks was examined using a generalized linear mixed model. Spatial clustering of the ecological data was modeled using 1) an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model at subdistrict level considering their first order neighbors, and 2) a multilevel (ML) model with subdistricts nested within districts. Ecological determinants significantly associated with risk of HPAI-H5N1 outbreaks at subdistrict level were migratory birds' staging areas, river network, household density, literacy rate, poultry density, live bird markets, and highway network. Predictive risk maps were derived based on the resulting models. The resulting models indicate that the ML model absorbed some of the covariate effect of the ICAR model because of the neighbor structure implied in the two different models. Conclusions/Significance The study identified a new set of ecological determinants related to river networks, migratory birds' staging areas and literacy rate in addition to already known risk factors, and clarified that the generalized concept of free grazing duck and duck-rice cultivation interacted ecology are not significant determinants for Bangladesh. These findings will refine current understanding of the HPAI-H5N1 epidemiology in Bangladesh.","2012-03-21","2015-09-23 09:13:20","2015-09-23 09:13:20","2015-09-23 09:13:20","e33938","","3","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/6MWSQJPZ/Ahmed et al. - 2012 - Ecological Determinants of Highly Pathogenic Avian.pdf","","KEY3; H5N1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods The association of demography and environmental risk factors including poultry density, human density, road density, percentage of paddy field, and percentage of swamp, dyke and pond with both HPAI human cases and HPAI outbreaks in poultry were assessed using a descriptive epidemiological design. We also assessed the association of HPAI outbreaks in poultry with HPAI human cases. Poisson regression (generalized linear modeling and generalized estimating equations) was used to analyze the data corrected for over-dispersion. Results There were 794 HPAI outbreaks in poultry covering 24 of the 25 districts in our study during 2003–2008 and 34 HPAI human cases involving 12 districts during 2005–2008. We found that two risk factors – poultry density and road density – had a statistically significant correlation with the number of HPAI outbreaks in poultry. The number of poultry outbreaks had a negative association with poultry density (29% effect) and a positive association with road density (67% effect). The number of human cases was significantly associated with the number of poultry outbreaks (34% effect), but with none of the other risk factors considered. Conclusions We conclude that the most effective way to prevent human HPAI cases is to intervene directly in the poultry sector. Our study further suggests that implementing preventive measures in backyard chicken farming and limiting transport of live poultry and their products are promising options to this end.","2010-09","2015-09-23 09:25:50","2015-09-23 09:25:50","2015-09-23 09:25:50","e800-e805","","9","14","","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WV8SQDBG/Yupiana et al. - 2010 - Risk factors of poultry outbreaks and human cases .pdf","","KEY3","H5N1; Indonesia; Poultry; Risk Factors; Human; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.","2006-12-19","2015-09-23 10:57:11","2015-09-23 10:57:11","2015-09-23 10:57:11","19368-19373","","51","103","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 17158217","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/X4UCXBAH/Kilpatrick et al. - 2006 - Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influen.pdf","","KEY3; H5N1","emerging; introduced species; model; trade; zoonotic disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission. Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised concerns about the potential of resilient free-ranging birds to disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of information about their migratory ecology. During 2007-08 we marked wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the location and timing of spring migration and identify any spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal (Anas falcata), Baikal teal (Anas formosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), garganey (Anas querquedula), and Chinese spotbill (Anas poecilohyncha). These wild ducks (excluding the resident mallard and Chinese spotbill ducks) followed the East Asian Flyway along the coast to breeding areas in northern China, eastern Mongolia, and eastern Russia. None migrated west toward Qinghai Lake (site of the largest wild bird epizootic), thus failing to demonstrate any migratory connection to the Central Asian Flyway. A newly developed Brownian bridge spatial analysis indicated that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported in the flyway were related to latitude and poultry density but not to the core migration corridor or to wetland habitats. Also, we found a temporal mismatch between timing of outbreaks and wild duck movements. These analyses depend on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks, but by documenting movements of wild waterfowl, we present ecological knowledge that better informs epidemiological investigations seeking to explain and predict the spread of avian influenza viruses.","2010-03","2015-09-22 12:32:17","2015-09-22 12:32:17","","466-476","","1 Suppl","54","","Avian Dis.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 20521681","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/AE6P7J6Z/Takekawa et al. - 2010 - Migration of waterfowl in the East Asian flyway an.pdf","","KEY3; H5N1","Animal Migration; Disease Outbreaks; Ducks; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Time Factors; Asia; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five of the seven epidemic waves occurred in the period of active poultry population buildup immediately prior to the Vietnamese New Year (Tết festival). Recorded outbreaks were clustered in space and time within both deltas, consistent with infection transmission occurring via a combination of local and long-distance spread. Our analyses demonstrate that the epidemiology of HPAI in Vietnam has changed over the 4-year study period, with outbreaks now occurring in the warmer months of the year and ducks featuring more prominently as affected species.

Conventional methods of model validation and selection assess in- or out-of-sample prediction accuracy but do not assess model generality or transferability, which can lead to overestimates of performance when predicting in other locations, time periods or data sets. 2. We propose an intuitive method for evaluating transferability based on techniques currently in use in the area of species distribution modelling. The method involves cross-validation in which data are assigned non-randomly to groups that are spatially, temporally or otherwise distinct, thus using heterogeneity in the data set as a surrogate for heterogeneity among data sets. 3. We illustrate the method by applying it to distribution modelling of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill) and brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus) in western United States. We show that machine-learning techniques such as random forests and artificial neural networks can produce models with excellent in-sample performance but poor transferability, unless complexity is constrained. In our example, traditional linear models have greater transferability. 4. We recommend the use of a transferability assessment whenever there is interest in making inferences beyond the data set used for model fitting. Such an assessment can be used both for validation and for model selection and provides important information beyond what can be learned from conventional validation and selection techniques.","2012-04-01","2015-09-22 13:32:19","2015-09-22 13:32:19","2015-09-22 13:32:19","260-267","","2","3","","","Assessing transferability of ecological models","","","","","","","en","© 2012 The Authors.

Although the risk of transmission of these viruses to humans was initially thought to be low, an outbreak investigation was launched to assess the extent of transmission of influenza A virus subtype H7N7 from chickens to humans.  Methods  All workers in poultry farms, poultry farmers, and their families were asked to report signs of conjunctivitis or influenza-like illness. People with complaints were tested for influenza virus type A subtype H7 (A/H7) infection and completed a health questionnaire about type of symptoms, duration of illness, and possible exposures to infected poultry.  Findings  453 people had health complaints—349 reported conjunctivitis, 90 had influenza-like illness, and 67 had other complaints. We detected A/H7 in conjunctival samples from 78 (26·4%) people with conjunctivitis only, in five (9·4%) with influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis, in two (5·4%) with influenza-like illness only, and in four (6%) who reported other symptoms. Most positive samples had been collected within 5 days of symptom onset. A/H7 infection was confirmed in three contacts (of 83 tested), one of whom developed influenza-like illness. Six people had influenza A/H3N2 infection. After 19 people had been diagnosed with the infection, all workers received mandatory influenza virus vaccination and prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir. More than half (56%) of A/H7 infections reported here arose before the vaccination and treatment programme.  Interpretation  We noted an unexpectedly high number of transmissions of avian influenza A virus subtype H7N7 to people directly involved in handling infected poultry, and we noted evidence for person-to-person transmission. Our data emphasise the importance of adequate surveillance, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic planning.","2004-02-21","2015-09-23 13:01:17","2015-09-23 13:01:17","2013-04-22 15:19:41","587-593","","9409","363","","The Lancet","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/CKP26BX2/Koopmans et al. - 2004 - Transmission of H7N7 avian influenza A virus to hu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","2011-12-01","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","2015-10-01 12:49:05","196-205","","3","102","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza control along poultry market chains in South China","Special Issue: GEOVET 2010A Conference on the Application of Spatial Analytical Methods Used in Animal HealthGEOVET 2010","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/URQRDM47/Martin et al. - 2011 - Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza contro.pdf","","KEY3; H5N1","Social network analysis; Market chains; Poultry; HPAI H5N1; Risk assessment; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complexity and inter-relations between topology, function and dynamical nature of the system are characterized at different spatial and time resolutions, in order to uncover patterns and vulnerabilities fundamental for the definition of targeted prevention and control measures for zoonotic diseases. Results show how the stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all timescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide important patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading potential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial longitudinal information. By fully taking into account the longitudinal dimension, we propose a novel definition of dynamical motifs that is able to uncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system and the causality patterns of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms that may play a crucial role in the definition of preventive actions.","2011-05-18","2015-10-01 12:54:34","2015-10-01 12:54:34","2015-10-01 12:54:34","e19869","","5","6","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7KXXIMZ3/Bajardi et al. - 2011 - Dynamical Patterns of Cattle Trade Movements.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the sustainability of interactive systems, each system should fall within its normal range of natural variation. This applies to individuals (as for fevers and hypertension, in medicine), populations (e.g. outbreaks of crop pests in agriculture), species (e.g. the rarity of endangerment in conservation) and ecosystems (e.g. abnormally low productivity or diversity in 'ecosystem-based management'). In this paper, we report tests of the hypothesis that the human species is ecologically normal. We reject the hypothesis for almost all of the cases we tested. Our species rarely falls within statistical confidence limits that envelop the central tendencies in variation among other species. For example, our population size, CO(2) production, energy use, biomass consumption and geographical range size differ from those of other species by orders of magnitude. We argue that other measures should be tested in a similar fashion to assess the prevalence of such differences and their practical implications.","2003-12-22","2015-10-01 13:04:09","2015-10-01 13:04:09","","2579-2583","","1533","270","","Proc Biol Sci","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 14728780 PMCID: 1691539","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major problem with Chinese meat statistics is that reported meat supply is far greater than consumption, and this is particularly true for pork. Factors contributing to the gap between pork supply and consumption include production over-reporting, loss and waste in the pork supply chain, pork consumed away from home (FAFH), and a mismatch in the Chinese rural household survey between food and mouths (i.e. migrant workers and boarding students who are counted as rural household members but live in urban areas for much of the year). Our estimates indicate that over-reporting of pork production has declined substantially since 2003, but it is still significant and is the largest contributor to the gap between reported supply and consumption. Our estimates also indicate that pork consumption is significantly under-estimated because of FAFH and the rural mismatch between food and mouths. Reforms to the agricultural statistical system should be considered that increase the incentives to report accurate production statistics. Statistics are currently based on reports from local officials who have incentives to inflate production figures so as to improve their performance reviews and prospects for promotion, or they are overseen by local statistical personnel appointed by local governments.","2014-09","2015-10-15 13:46:59","2015-10-15 13:46:59","2015-07-14 12:30:11","469-484","","","30","","China Economic Review","Where have all the pigs gone?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4WVUAK2G/Yu and Abler - 2014 - Where have all the pigs gone Inconsistencies in p.pdf","","","Consumption; Pork; Production; Statistics; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using phylogenetic history to correct for spatial autocorrelation, we illustrate how a fundamental spatial variable, the diffusion coefficient, can be estimated using robust nonparametric statistics, and how heterogeneity in dispersal can be readily quantified. We apply this framework to the spread of the West Nile virus across North America, an important recent instance of spatial invasion by an emerging infectious disease. We demonstrate that the dispersal of West Nile virus is greater and far more variable than previously measured, such that its dissemination was critically determined by rare, long-range movements that are unlikely to be discerned during field observations. Our results indicate that, by ignoring this heterogeneity, previous models of the epidemic have substantially overestimated its basic reproductive number. More generally, our approach demonstrates that easily obtainable genetic data can be used to measure the spatial dynamics of natural populations that are otherwise difficult or costly to quantify.","2012-09-11","2015-10-15 13:49:57","2015-10-15 13:49:57","2015-01-23 16:49:16","15066-15071","","37","109","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 22927414","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XS3MCG6D/Pybus et al. - 2012 - Unifying the spatial epidemiology and molecular ev.pdf","","","transmission; Phylogeny; Phylogeography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our comprehensive spatially explicit inventory of N and P budgets in livestock and crop production systems shows that in the beginning of the 20th century, nutrient budgets were either balanced or surpluses were small; between 1900 and 1950, global soil N surplus almost doubled to 36 trillion grams (Tg)·y−1 and P surplus increased by a factor of 8 to 2 Tg·y−1. Between 1950 and 2000, the global surplus increased to 138 Tg·y−1 of N and 11 Tg·y−1 of P. Most surplus N is an environmental loss; surplus P is lost by runoff or accumulates as residual soil P. The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science, and Technology for Development scenario portrays a world with a further increasing global crop (+82% for 2000–2050) and livestock production (+115%); despite rapidly increasing recovery in crop (+35% N recovery and +6% P recovery) and livestock (+35% N and P recovery) production, global nutrient surpluses continue to increase (+23% N and +54% P), and in this period, surpluses also increase in Africa (+49% N and +236% P) and Latin America (+75% N and +120% P). Alternative management of livestock production systems shows that combinations of intensification, better integration of animal manure in crop production, and matching N and P supply to livestock requirements can effectively reduce nutrient flows. A shift in human diets, with poultry or pork replacing beef, can reduce nutrient flows in countries with intensive ruminant production.","2013-12-24","2015-10-15 13:53:08","2015-10-15 13:53:08","2015-01-23 15:41:53","20882-20887","","52","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 21576477","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HRWJ5RT4/Bouwman et al. - 2013 - Exploring global changes in nitrogen and phosphoru.pdf","","","emissions; global nitrogen and phosphorus cycle; soil nutrient budget","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sustainable intensification of livestock production systems might become a key climate mitigation technology. However, livestock production systems vary substantially, making the implementation of climate mitigation policies a formidable challenge. Here, we provide results from an economic model using a detailed and high-resolution representation of livestock production systems. We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e⋅y−1), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US$10 per tCO2e could lead to an abatement of 3,223 MtCO2e⋅y−1. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21% of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40%, and all other mechanisms would add 39%. A comparable abatement of 3,068 MtCO2e⋅y−1 could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally. We find that mitigation policies targeting emissions from land-use change are 5 to 10 times more efficient—measured in “total abatement calorie cost”—than policies targeting emissions from livestock only. Thus, fostering transitions toward more productive livestock production systems in combination with climate policies targeting the land-use change appears to be the most efficient lever to deliver desirable climate and food availability outcomes.","2014-03-11","2015-10-15 13:54:11","2015-10-15 13:54:11","2015-01-23 15:39:57","3709-3714","","10","111","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 24567375","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/AS3WFNWB/Havlík et al. - 2014 - Climate change mitigation through livestock system.pdf","","","deforestation; food security; marginal abatement cost; mathematical programming; productivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our imperfect ability to detect and report disease hinders assessment of trends, but we suggest that, although endemic diseases continue their historic decline in wealthy countries, poor countries experience static or deteriorating animal health and epidemic diseases show both regression and expansion. At a mesolevel, disease is changing in terms of space and host, which is illustrated by bluetongue, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus, and it is also emerging, as illustrated by highly pathogenic avian influenza and others. Major proximate drivers of change in disease dynamics include ecosystem change, ecosystem incursion, and movements of people and animals; underlying these are demographic change and an increasing demand for livestock products. We identify three trajectories of global disease dynamics: (i) the worried well in developed countries (demanding less risk while broadening the circle of moral concern), (ii) the intensifying and market-orientated systems of many developing countries, where highly complex disease patterns create hot spots for disease shifts, and (iii) the neglected cold spots in poor countries, where rapid change in disease dynamics is less likely but smallholders and pastoralists continue to struggle with largely preventable and curable livestock diseases.","2013-12-24","2015-10-15 13:54:38","2015-10-15 13:54:38","2015-01-23 15:42:55","20871-20877","","52","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 21576468","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/D4WKBQIQ/Perry et al. - 2013 - Current drivers and future directions of global li.pdf","","","disease drivers; diversity of disease trajectories; spatial and host dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.","2011","2015-10-15 13:55:44","2015-10-15 13:55:44","2013-05-04 07:22:28","43–57","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/32MEAVH9/Elith et al. - 2011 - A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists.pdf","","","Absence; ecological niche; entropy; Machine learning; species distribution model; presence-only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Americas, the H7 IAVs are of particular concern, and there have been four separate outbreaks of highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 in domestic poultry in North and South America between 2002 and 2012, with occasional spillover into humans. Here, we use long-term IAV surveillance in North American shorebirds at Delaware Bay, USA, from 1985 to 2012 and in ducks in Alberta, Canada, from 1976 to 2012 to determine which hemagglutinin (HA)–neuraminidase (NA) combinations predominated in Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds) and whether there is concordance between peaks of H7 prevalence and transmission in wild aquatic birds and the emergence of H7 IAVs in poultry and humans. Whole-genome sequencing supported phylogenetic and genomic constellation analyses to determine whether HP IAVs emerge in the context of specific internal gene segment sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences of the H7N3 influenza viruses from wild birds and HP H7N3 outbreaks in the Americas indicate that each HP outbreak was an independent emergence event and that the low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza precursors were most likely from dabbling ducks. The different polybasic cleavage sites in the four HP outbreaks support independent origins. At the 95% nucleotide percent identity-level phylogenetic analysis showed that the wild duck HA, PB1, and M sequences clustered with the poultry and human outbreak sequences. The genomic constellation analysis strongly suggests that gene segments/virus flow from wild birds to domestic poultry.","2015-06-17","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-09-25 13:51:16","e35","","6","4","","Emerg Microbes Infect","Long-term surveillance of H7 influenza viruses in American wild aquatic birds","","","","","","","en","© 2015 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HAEG5IBG/Krauss et al. - 2015 - Long-term surveillance of H7 influenza viruses in .pdf","","","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza; American wild birds; Anseriforme; Charadriiforme; H7; surveillance; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design  Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed on sera from ostrich farms in the outbreak region, and intravenous pathogenicity (IVPI) tests, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed on the HPAI H5N2 virus isolated during the outbreak. Results  The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing was PQREKRRKKRGLF and thus the virus fell within the definition of a highly pathogenic virus, but in an IVPI test in chickens on the virus isolated from the index case and a value of 0·63 was recorded, which is below the criterion for highly pathogenic viruses in this in vivo test. After a further passage in embryonated eggs a second IVPI was carried out and an elevated value of 1·19 was obtained. Cloacal swabs were taken from the initial IVPI birds, inoculated into embryonated chickens eggs and a third IVPI was then performed on the resulting haemagglutinating, infective allantoic fluid. An index of 2·73 was recorded. Conclusions  HI tests appeared to be the more sensitive test compared to AGID when testing for antibodies to avian influenza in sera. An ostrich-derived virus with a virulent HA0 cleavage site was not initially virulent in chickens but after passage in the latter the virulence increased. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the link between AI viruses carried by wild ducks and those infecting ostriches.","2009-03-01","2015-10-27 06:15:25","2015-10-27 06:15:25","2015-10-27 06:15:25","63-68","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SEJJVXE6/Abolnik et al. - 2009 - Characterisation of a highly pathogenic influenza .pdf","","","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza; intravenous pathogenicity index test; ostrich; H5N2; Phylogeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A newly emerged HPAI A(H5N8) virus caused poultry outbreaks in the Republic of Korea in 2014. Because newly emerging high-pathogenicity H5 viruses continue to pose public health risks, it is imperative that their pathobiological properties be examined. Here, we characterized A/mallard duck/Korea/W452/2014 (MDk/W452(H5N8)), a representative virus, and evaluated its pathogenic and pandemic potential in various animal models. We found that MDk/W452(H5N8), which originated from the reassortment of wild bird viruses harbored by migratory waterfowl in eastern China, replicated systemically and was lethal in chickens, but appeared to be attenuated, albeit efficiently transmitted, in ducks. Despite predominant attachment to avian-like virus receptors, MDk/W452(H5N8) also exhibited detectable human virus-like receptor binding and replicated in human respiratory tract tissues. In mice, MDk/W452(H5N8) was moderately pathogenic and had limited tissue tropism relative to previous HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. It also induced moderate nasal wash titers in inoculated ferrets; additionally, it was recovered in extrapulmonary tissues and one of three direct-contact ferrets seroconverted without shedding. Moreover, domesticated cats appeared to be more susceptible than dogs to virus infection. With their potential to become established in ducks, continued circulation of A(H5N8) viruses could alter the genetic evolution of pre-existing avian poultry strains. Overall, detailed virological investigation remains a necessity given the capacity of H5 viruses to evolve to cause human illness with few changes in the viral genome.","2014-10","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-09-22 09:41:48","e75","","10","3","","Emerg Microbes Infect","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26038499 PMCID: PMC4217095","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/IAFT574U/Kim et al. - 2014 - Pathobiological features of a novel, highly pathog.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This outbreak may help to spread the virus over and beyond the Himalayas and has important implications for developing control strategies.","2005-07-14","2015-10-27 03:59:45","2015-10-27 03:59:45","2015-10-27 03:59:45","191-192","","7048","436","","Nature","Avian flu","","","","","","","en","© 2005 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/T2CFXEG2/Chen et al. - 2005 - Avian flu H5N1 virus outbreak in migratory waterf.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/Z7PERTI9/nature03974.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether H7N9 and H5N1 infections correlate with climate factors has not been examined. Here, we analyzed 350 cases of H7N9 infection and 47 cases of H5N1 infection. The spatial characteristics of these cases revealed that H5N1 infections mainly occurred in the South, Middle, and Northwest of China, while the occurrence of H7N9 was concentrated in coastal areas of East and South of China. Aside from spatial-temporal characteristics, the most adaptive meteorological conditions for the occurrence of human infections by these two viral subtypes were different. We found that H7N9 infections correlate with climate factors, especially temperature (TEM) and relative humidity (RHU), while H5N1 infections correlate with TEM and atmospheric pressure (PRS). Hence, we propose a risky window (TEM 4-14 °C and RHU 65-95%) for H7N9 infection and (TEM 2-22 °C and PRS 980-1025 kPa) for H5N1 infection. Our results represent the first step in determining the effects of climate factors on two different virus infections in China and provide warning guidelines for the future when provinces fall into the risky windows. These findings revealed integrated predictive meteorological factors rooted in statistic data that enable the establishment of preventive actions and precautionary measures against future outbreaks.","2015","2015-12-17 06:09:13","2015-12-17 06:09:13","","18094","","","5","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26656876","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/V3FQV77F/Li et al. - 2015 - Identification of climate factors related to human.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of the whole-genome analysis indicated that an H5N1 virus with a new genotype is circulating among tree sparrows. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the new genotype were derived from Gs/Gd/96-like viruses and the nuclear protein gene descended from the 2001 genotype A H5N1 viruses, while the other inner genes originated from an unknown influenza virus. In experimental infection, all four viruses were highly pathogenic to chickens but not pathogenic to ducks or mice.

This was accompanied by an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus of type H9N2 in broilers and layers, which continued during 2005. Subsequently, in February 2006 avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 was for the first time found in two isolated commercial flocks in this country. The HPAI outbreak of 2003-2004 was eventually overcome by enforcing biosecurity measures, controlling poultry movements, using inactivated vaccines, and introducing a comprehensive AI surveillance network throughout the country. However, similar measures undertaken to control H9N2 outbreaks have not been successful in the affected areas, with continuing increased mortality and heavy production losses in broilers and layers, respectively.

The control measures markedly reduced the transmission of HPAI virus: Rh before detection of the outbreak in the first infected flock was 6.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1–9.9) in one area and 3.1 in another area, and it decreased to 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) after detection of the first outbreak in both areas.

First isolated from chickens in May of 1994, after spreading widely in the country, the virus caused only a mild respiratory syndrome in specific pathogen-free chickens. Because eradication of the virus by destruction of infected birds posed major obstacles to the poultry industry in Mexico, we were able to conduct a ""field experiment"" to determine the fate of an avirulent virus after repeated cycles of replication in millions of chickens. By the end of 1994, the virus had mutated to contain a highly cleavable hemagglutinin (HA), but remained only mildly pathogenic in chickens. Within months, however, it had become lethal in poultry. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA cleavage site of the original avirulent strain revealed R-E-T-R, typical of avirulent viruses and unlike the K-K-K-R sequence characterizing viruses responsible for the 1983 outbreak in poultry in the United States. Both mildly and highly pathogenic isolates contained insertions and a substitution of basic residues in the HA connecting peptide, R-K-R-K-T-R, which made the HA highly cleavable in trypsin-free chicken embryo fibroblasts. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA of H5 avian influenza viruses, including the Mexican isolates, indicated that the epidemic virus had originated from the introduction of a single virus of the North American lineage into Mexican chickens. This sequence of events demonstrates, apparently for the first time, the stepwise acquisition of virulence by an avian influenza virus in nature.","1995-10-20","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-21 04:45:37","223-230","","1","213","","Virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GRMH8AQ2/Horimoto et al. - 1995 - Origin and Molecular Changes Associated with Emerg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, clinical manifestations in the affected flock were consistent with avian influenza caused by a low-pathogenicity AIV and the representative virus (A/chicken/Texas/298313/04 [TX/04]) was not virulent for experimentally inoculated chickens. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the TX/04 isolate was similar in sequence to A/chicken/Texas/167280-4/02 (TX/02), a low-pathogenicity AIV isolate recovered from chickens in Texas in 2002. However, the TX/04 isolate had one additional basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site, which could be attributed to a single point mutation. The TX/04 isolate was similar in sequence to TX/02 isolate in several internal genes (NP, M, and NS), but some genes (PA, PB1, and PB2) had sequence of a clearly different origin. The TX/04 isolate also had a stalk deletion in the NA gene, characteristic of a chicken-adapted AIV. By analyzing viruses constructed by in vitro mutagenesis followed by reverse genetics, we found that the pathogenicity of the TX/04 virus could be increased in vitro and in vivo by the insertion of an additional basic amino acid at the HA cleavage site and not by the loss of a glycosylation site near the cleavage site. Our study provides the genetic and biologic characteristics of the TX/04 isolate, which highlight the complexity of the polygenic nature of the virulence of influenza viruses.","2005-09","2015-10-27 02:45:44","2015-10-27 02:45:44","2015-10-27 02:45:44","11412-11421","","17","79","","J Virol","H5N2 Avian Influenza Outbreak in Texas in 2004","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 16103192 PMCID: PMC1193578","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/N5G83R6H/Lee et al. - 2005 - H5N2 Avian Influenza Outbreak in Texas in 2004 th.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The avirulent virus produced plaques and cleaved the HA only in the presence of trypsin. In contrast, the virulent virus produced plaques and cleaved the HA precursor into HA1 and HA2 in the presence or absence of trypsin. The apparent molecular weight of the HA1 from the avirulent virus was higher than that from the virulent virus, but when the viruses were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, the molecular weights of HA were indistinguishable. Two of nine monoclonal antibodies to the HA of the avirulent virus indicate that there is at least one epitope on the HA that is different between the virulent and avirulent viruses. The amino acid sequences of the HAs from the two viruses were compared by sequencing their respective HA gene. The nucleotide sequence coding for the processed HA polypeptide contained 1641 nucleotides specifying a protein of 547 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the virulent and avirulent viruses were indistinguishable through the connecting peptide region, indicating that the difference in cleavability of the H5 HA is not directly attributed to the amino acid sequence of the connecting peptide. Four of seven nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes at residues 13, 69, and 123 of HA1 and at residue 501 of the HA2 polypeptide. Since there were no deletions or insertions in the amino acid sequence of the virulent or avirulent viruses, the possibility exists that the difference in molecular weight is due to loss of a carbohydrate side chain in the virulent strain. The amino acid change in the virulent strain at residue 13 is the only mutation that could affect a glycosylation site and this is in the vicinity of the connecting peptide. It is postulated that the loss of this carbohydrate may permit access of an enzyme that recognizes the basic amino acid sequences and results in cleavage activation of the HA in the virulent virus.","1984-12","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","","303-316","","2","139","","Virology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 6516214","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/F5PWH9WD/Kawaoka et al. - 1984 - Is virulence of H5N2 influenza viruses in chickens.pdf","","","Carbohydrates; Viral Plaque Assay; Amino Acid Sequence; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Base Sequence; Chick Embryo; Chickens; DNA, Viral; Hemagglutinins, Viral; Influenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtype; RNA, Viral; Serotyping; Species Specificity; Virulence; influenza A virus; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen isolates, collected during a 15 month period (October 1993 to January 1995) from six central states, were sequenced. None of the 18 predicted HA1 amino acid sequences were identical and changes were not restricted to a specific region of the sequence. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA1 sequences demonstrated two virus lineages, designated Puebla and Jalisco, with sequence variation as high as 10.5 percent for amino acid and 6.2 percent for nucleotide sequences. During the latter months of the surveillance period, highly pathogenic (HP) strains of AI emerged causing lethal disease in commercial poultry flocks. In each of the HP strains isolated, the HA protein was cleaved in chicken embryo fibroblast cells in the absence of trypsin, and two alterations not found in earlier non-HP isolates were detected. In the HA protein, HP strains all had a glutamic acid --> lysine substitution at amino acid position 324 and an insertion of arginine and lysine as new residues 325 and 326. The insertion appears to be due to a duplication of the nucleotide sequence AAAGAA at nucleotide positions 965-970 of the HA1-coding region. Computer-assisted secondary structure analyses place the target for the insertion in a predicted RNA stem-loop structure. A mechanism is suggested by which the polymerase duplicates the sequence.","1996-07","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","","1493-1504","","","77 ( Pt 7)","","J. Gen.

At least two of the three pandemics in the last century, including 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, originated from this area. In 1996, A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1), the precursor of currently circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) was identified in farmed geese in southern China. These H5N1 HPAIVs have been spread across Asia, Europe and Africa and poses a continuous threat to both animal and human health. However, how and where this H5N1 HPAIV emerged are not fully understood. In the past decade, many influenza surveillance efforts have been carried out in southern China, and our understanding of the genetic diversity of non-human influenza A viruses in this area has been much better than ever. Here, the historical and first-hand experimental data on A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996(H5N1)-like HPAIVs are reviewed within the context of the findings from recent surveillance efforts on H5N1 HPAIVs and other non-human influenza A viruses. Such a retrospective recapitulation suggests that long-term and systematic surveillance programmes should continue to be implemented in southern China that the wet markets on the animal–human interface shall be the priority area and that the surveillance on the animal species bridging the interface between wildlife and domestic animal populations and the interface between the aquatics and territories shall be the strengthened.","2012-09-01","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-22 05:42:06","32-42","","","59","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KCMNPXPW/Wan - 2012 - Lessons from Emergence of AGooseGuangdong1996-L.pdf","","","A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996(H5N1); H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; molecular evolution; southern China; Ecology; influenza A virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate that the H5N1 viruses circulating in poultry comprised two distinguishable phylogenetic lineages in all genes that were in very rapid evolution. When introduced into new hosts, influenza viruses usually undergo rapid alteration of their surface glycoproteins, especially in the hemagglutinin (HA). Surprisingly, these H5N1 isolates had a large proportion of amino acid changes in all gene products except in the HA. These viruses maybe reassortants each of whose HA gene is well adapted to domestic poultry while the rest of the genome arises from a different source.

However little attention has been paid to the link between the level of intensification of poultry production and the risk of outbreak. This study revised H5N1 risk mapping in Central and Western Thailand during the second wave of the 2004 epidemic. Production structure was quantified using a disaggregation methodology based on the number of poultry per holding. Population densities of extensively- and intensively-raised ducks and chickens were derived both at the sub-district and at the village levels. LandSat images were used to derive another previously neglected potential predictor of HPAI H5N1 risk: the proportion of water in the landscape resulting from floods. We used Monte Carlo simulation of Boosted Regression Trees models of predictor variables to characterize the risk of HPAI H5N1. Maps of mean risk and uncertainty were derived both at the sub-district and the village levels. The overall accuracy of Boosted Regression Trees models was comparable to that of logistic regression approaches. The proportion of area flooded made the highest contribution to predicting the risk of outbreak, followed by the densities of intensively-raised ducks, extensively-raised ducks and human population. Our results showed that as little as 15% of flooded land in villages is sufficient to reach the maximum level of risk associated with this variable. The spatial pattern of predicted risk is similar to previous work: areas at risk are mainly located along the flood plain of the Chao Phraya river and to the south-east of Bangkok. Using high-resolution village-level poultry census data, rather than sub-district data, the spatial accuracy of predictions was enhanced to highlight local variations in risk. Such maps provide useful information to guide intervention.","2012-11-19","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-09-22 14:37:25","e49528","","11","7","","PLOS ONE","Improving Risk Models for Avian Influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/PX675U5X/Van Boeckel et al. - 2012 - Improving Risk Models for Avian Influenza The Rol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three of the viruses had similar pathogenicity among infected domestic ducks: the H5N8 viruses were moderately pathogenic (0%–20% mortality rate); in wild mallard ducks, the H5N8 and H5N1 viruses did not cause severe illness or death; viral replication and shedding were greater in H5N8-infected mallards than in H5N1-infected mallards.

Crows of two species, Corvus splendens and C. macrorhynchos, were found sick and dead during the outbreaks. In selected crow roosts, morbidity was  ~1 % and mortality was ~4 % during the investigation. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 was isolated from dead crows. All isolates were closely related to A/duck/India/02CA10/2011 (H5N1) with 99.8 % and A/crow/Bangladesh/11rs1984-15/2011 (H5N1) virus with 99 % nucleotide sequence identity in their HA genes. The phylogenetic cluster of Bangladesh viruses suggested a common ancestor with viruses found in poultry from India, Myanmar and Nepal. Histopathological changes and immunohistochemistry staining in brain, pancreas, liver, heart, kidney, bursa of Fabricius, rectum, and cloaca were consistent with influenza virus infection. Through our limited investigation in domesticated birds near the crow roosts, we did not identify any samples that tested positive for influenza virus A/H5N1. However, environmental samples collected from live-bird markets near an outbreak site during the month of the outbreaks tested very weakly positive for influenza virus A/H5N1 in clade 2.3.2.1-specific rRT-PCR.

Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H5N1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005.

The hemagglutinin genes of the A/HK/212/03-like viruses isolated from humans and waterfowl share the lineage of the H5N1 viruses that caused the first known cases of human disease in Hong Kong in 1997, but their internal protein genes originated elsewhere. The hemagglutinin of the recent human isolates has undergone significant antigenic drift. Like the 1997 human H5N1 isolates, the 2003 human H5N1 isolates induced the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by primary human macrophages in vitro, whereas the precursor H5N1 viruses and other H5N1 reassortants isolated in 2001 did not.

The virus responsible for the epidemic was subtyped as H7N1 with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0.0, and a deduced amino acid sequence of the region coding for the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin molecule typical of low pathogenicity viruses. The circulation of the virus in a susceptible population for several months caused the emergence of a highly pathogenic virus with an IVPI of 3.0 and the presence of multiple basic amino acids in the deduced amino acid sequence for the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin molecule. Over 13 million birds were affected by the epidemic and, in the present paper, we report the results of the clinical, virological and histopathological investigations performed on affected chickens and turkeys. Clinical, gross and microscopic lesions caused by LPAI were more severe in turkeys than in chickens, while highly pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) caused similar mortality rates in both species. Current European legislation considers LPAI and HPAI as two completely distinct diseases, not requiring any compulsory eradication policy for LPAI but enforcing eradication for HPAI. In the Italian 1999 to 2000 epidemic, LPAI mutated to HPAI in a densely populated area, causing great economic losses. A reconsideration of the current European Union legislation on avian influenza, including LPAI of the H5 and H7 subtypes, could possibly be an aid to avoiding devastating epidemics for the poultry industry.","2000-12","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:04:38","537-543","","6","29","","Avian Pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/E8M7F79B/Capua et al. - 2000 - H7N1 avian influenza in Italy (1999 to 2000) in in.pdf","","","ITALY; Poultry Diseases; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such motif is found in H7N3 strains from chicken farm outbreaks in 2012 in Mexico. Methods Through phylogenetic, sequence and structural analysis, we try to shed light on the role, prevalence, likelihood of appearance and origin of the inserted cleavage motifs in these H7N3 avian influenza strains. Results The H7N3 avian influenza strain which caused outbreaks in chicken farms in June/July 2012 in Mexico has a new extended cleavage site which is the likely reason for its high pathogenicity in these birds. This cleavage site appears to have been naturally acquired and was not present in the closest low pathogenic precursors. Structural modeling shows that insertion of a productive cleavage site is quite flexible to accept insertions of different length and with sequences from different possible origins. Different from recent cleavage site insertions, the origin of the insert here is not from the viral genome but from host 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) instead. This is a novelty for a natural acquisition as a similar insertion has so far only been observed in a laboratory strain before. Given the abundance of viral and host RNA in infected cells, the acquisition of a pathogenicity-enhancing extended cleavage site through a similar route by other low-pathogenic avian strains in future does not seem unlikely. Important for surveillance of these H7N3 strains, the structural sites known to enhance mammalian airborne transmission are dominated by the characteristic avian residues and the risk of human to human transmission should currently be low but should be monitored for future changes accordingly.

H.","History of highly pathogenic avian influenza.","Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)","","","","","The most widely quoted date for the beginning of the recorded history of avian influenza (AI) is 1878, when researchers first differentiated a disease of poultry (initially known as fowl plague but later renamed highly pathogenic avian influenza) from other diseases with high mortality rates. Current evidence indicates that highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) viruses arise through mutation after low pathogenicity AI viruses of H5 or H7 subtype are introduced into poultry. Between 1877 and 1958, a number of epizootics of HPAI occurred in most parts of the world. From 1959 to 1995, the emergence of HPAI viruses was recorded on 15 occasions, but losses were minimal. In contrast, between 1996 and 2008, HPAI viruses emerged at least 11 times and four of these outbreaks involved many millions of birds. Events during this recent period are overshadowed by the current epizootic of HPAI due to an H5N1 virus that has spread throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, affecting over 60 countries and causing the loss of hundreds of millions of birds. All sectors of the poultry population have been affected, but free-range commercial ducks, village poultry, live bird markets and fighting cocks seem especially significant in the spread of the virus. The role of wild birds has been extensively debated but it is likely that both wild birds  and domestic poultry are responsible for its spread. Even without these H5N1 outbreaks, the period 1995 to 2008 will be considered significant in the history  of HPAI because of the vast numbers of birds that died or were culled in three of the other ten epizootics during this time.","2009-04","2015-10-23 09:13:09","2015-10-23 09:13:09","","","","1","28","","Rev Sci Tech","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19618616","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/69VWAJJW/Alexander and Brown - 2009 - History of highly pathogenic avian influenza..pdf","","Disease Outbreaks/*history/veterinary; History, 19th Century; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/pathogenicity; Influenza A virus/*classification/*pathogenicity; Influenza in Birds/epidemiology/*history/virology; Animals; Birds; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technologies supporting pervasive services like cellular networks have the potential to generate vast quantities of detailed subscriber data, raising important privacy concerns. But they also provide to researchers and city planners an unprecedented opportunity to understand the presence and movement of physical communities. We demonstrate how aggregated communication records offer the opportunity to note where people are transmitting and receiving information. The emergence of these spatial imprints obtained through novel technological means has a significant potential to support urban studies and particularly the optimization of tourism strategies, plans and marketing tools. In this study, we examine the use of locally and non-locally registered mobile phones in the vicinity of the “Waterfalls” public exhibit in New York City in 2008. We study aggregated statistics (i.e. number of calls) related to the network sectors covering the exhibit and its proximity. With the future contribution of traditional survey techniques, such as field counts, to calibrate these mobile phone network measurements, we aim to develop techniques to estimate the aggregate movements and location of visitors through time and space, while assuring their privacy.","","2015-10-27 15:48:09","2015-10-27 15:48:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong, China","","","","","","","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/5TDE9MRB/Girardin et al. - Towards estimating the presence of visitors from t.pdf","","mobile phones; tourism; urban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11th International Conference on Computers in Urban Planning and Urban Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.","2014-11-11","2015-10-27 15:46:06","2015-10-27 15:46:06","2014-11-12 08:05:26","15888-15893","","45","111","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 25349388","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XNH7NETK/Deville et al. - 2014 - Dynamic population mapping using mobile phone data.pdf","","","Census; Human mobility; Remote sensing; phone calls; Population distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Asymptomatic individuals can unknowingly carry parasites to regions where mosquito vectors are available, for example, undermining control programs and contributing to transmission when they travel. Understanding how parasites are imported between regions in this way is therefore an important goal for elimination planning and the control of transmission, and would enable control programs to target the principal sources of malaria. Measuring human mobility has traditionally been difficult to do on a population scale, but the widespread adoption of mobile phones in low-income settings presents a unique opportunity to directly measure human movements that are relevant to the spread of malaria. Here, we discuss the opportunities for measuring human mobility using data from mobile phones, as well as some of the issues associated with combining mobility estimates with malaria infection risk maps to meaningfully estimate routes of parasite importation.","2013-01","2015-10-27 15:51:45","2015-10-27 15:51:45","2015-10-27 15:51:45","15-22","","1","11","","Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","Mobile phones and malaria","Special Issue : Malaria Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9XFIQATC/Buckee et al. - 2013 - Mobile phones and malaria Modeling human and para.pdf","","","Human mobility; Mobile phones; Parasite importation; Malaria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We put forward an alternative methodological approach using call detail records of mobile phones to assess the composition of traffic flows during the evening rush hour in Tallinn, Estonia. We found that daily commuting and suburbanites influence transportation demand by amplifying the evening rush hour traffic, although daily commuting trips comprises only 31% of all movement at that time. The geography of the Friday evening rush hour is distinctive from other working days, presumably in connection with domestic tourism and leisure time activities. This suggests that the rise of the overall mobility of individuals due to societal changes may play a greater role in evening rush hour traffic conditions than does the impact of suburbanisation.","2012-11-14","2015-10-27 15:48:18","2015-10-27 15:48:18","2013-12-31 16:00:11","e49171","","11","7","","PLoS ONE","Mobile Phones in a Traffic Flow","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/IG4S3ME8/Järv et al. - 2012 - Mobile Phones in a Traffic Flow A Geographical Pe.pdf","","mobile phones; mobility; Population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estimates of Zanzibar's importation rate were calculated through two independent methodologies. First, mobile phone usage data and ferry traffic between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania were re-analyzed using a model of heterogeneous travel risk. Second, a dynamic mathematical model of importation and transmission rates was used. Zanzibar residents traveling to malaria endemic regions were estimated to contribute 1–15 times more imported cases than infected visitors. The malaria importation rate was estimated to be 1.6 incoming infections per 1,000 inhabitants per year. Local transmission was estimated too low to sustain transmission in most places. Malaria infections in Zanzibar largely result from imported malaria and subsequent transmission. Plasmodium falciparum malaria elimination appears feasible by implementing control measures based on detecting imported malaria cases and controlling onward transmission.","2011-09-15","2015-10-27 15:48:30","2015-10-27 15:48:30","2013-10-30 08:36:15","","","","1","","Sci.

To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached, we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.","2013-10-11","2015-10-27 15:38:55","2015-10-27 15:38:55","2014-04-03 09:01:50","","","2923","3","","Sci.

These movements make it difficult for relief organizations to efficiently reach people in need. Understanding and predicting the locations of affected people during disasters is key to effective humanitarian relief operations and to long-term societal reconstruction. We collaborated with the largest mobile phone operator in Haiti (Digicel) and analyzed the movements of 1.9 million mobile phone users during the period from 42 d before, to 341 d after the devastating Haiti earthquake of January 12, 2010. Nineteen days after the earthquake, population movements had caused the population of the capital Port-au-Prince to decrease by an estimated 23%. Both the travel distances and size of people’s movement trajectories grew after the earthquake. These findings, in combination with the disorder that was present after the disaster, suggest that people’s movements would have become less predictable. Instead, the predictability of people’s trajectories remained high and even increased slightly during the three-month period after the earthquake. Moreover, the destinations of people who left the capital during the first three weeks after the earthquake was highly correlated with their mobility patterns during normal times, and specifically with the locations in which people had significant social bonds. For the people who left Port-au-Prince, the duration of their stay outside the city, as well as the time for their return, all followed a skewed, fat-tailed distribution. The findings suggest that population movements during disasters may be significantly more predictable than previously thought.","2012-06-18","2015-10-27 15:38:40","2015-10-27 15:38:40","2014-04-03 08:55:47","11576–11581","","","109","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 22711804","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/UQEXAPGM/Lu et al. - 2012 - Predictability of population displacement after th.pdf","","","Human mobility; disaster informatics; disaster relief; trajectory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we quantify the effects of ownership bias on mobility estimates by coupling two data sources from the same country during the same time frame. We analyse mobility patterns from one of the largest mobile phone datasets studied, representing the daily movements of nearly 15 million individuals in Kenya over the course of a year. We couple this analysis with the results from a survey of socioeconomic status, mobile phone ownership and usage patterns across the country, providing regional estimates of population distributions of income, reported airtime expenditure and actual airtime expenditure across the country. We match the two data sources and show that mobility estimates are surprisingly robust to the substantial biases in phone ownership across different geographical and socioeconomic groups.","2013","2015-10-27 15:40:00","2015-10-27 15:40:00","","20120986","","81","10","","J R Soc Interface","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","NCBI PubMed","","PMID: 23389897  PMCID: PMC3627108","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GNMEZXJG/Wesolowski et al. - 2013 - The impact of biases in mobile phone ownership on .pdf","","","Selection Bias; Humans; Models, Biological; Socioeconomic Factors; Cellular Phone; Kenya; Motor Activity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subbarao et al., Science 279:393–395, 1998). Gene sequences of this human isolate were compared to those of a highly pathogenic chicken H5N1 influenza virus isolated from Hong Kong in April 1997. Sequence comparisons of all eight RNA segments from the two viruses show greater than 99% sequence identity between them. However, neither isolate’s gene sequence was closely (>95% sequence identity) related to any other gene sequences found in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences of at least four of the eight RNA segments clustered with Eurasian origin avian influenza viruses. The hemagglutinin gene phylogenetic analysis also included the sequences from an additional three human and two chicken H5N1 virus isolates from Hong Kong, and the isolates separated into two closely related groups. However, no single amino acid change separated the chicken origin and human origin isolates, but they all contained multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, which is associated with a highly pathogenic phenotype in poultry. In experimental intravenous inoculation studies with chickens, all seven viruses were highly pathogenic, killing most birds within 24 h. All infected chickens had virtually identical pathologic lesions, including moderate to severe diffuse edema and interstitial pneumonitis. Viral nucleoprotein was most frequently demonstrated in vascular endothelium, macrophages, heterophils, and cardiac myocytes. Asphyxiation from pulmonary edema and generalized cardiovascular collapse were the most likely pathogenic mechanisms responsible for illness and death. In summary, a small number of changes in hemagglutinin gene sequences defined two closely related subgroups, with both subgroups having human and chicken members, among the seven viruses examined from Hong Kong, and all seven viruses were highly pathogenic in chickens and caused similar lesions in experimental inoculations.","1998-08","2016-01-12 08:49:34","2016-01-12 08:49:34","2016-01-12 08:49:34","6678-6688","","8","72","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 9658115 PMCID: PMC109865","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3G5EXGQX/Suarez et al. - 1998 - Comparisons of Highly Virulent H5N1 Influenza A Vi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that all the precursors of H5N1/97 are still circulating in poultry in southern China, the reassortment event that generated H5N1 could be repeated. Because A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (H5N1; Go/Gd) viruses are the proposed donors of the hemagglutinin gene of the H5N1 virus, we investigated the continued circulation, host range, and transmissibility of Go/Gd-like viruses in poultry. The Go/Gd-like viruses caused weight loss and death in some mice inoculated with high virus doses. Transmission of Go/Gd-like H5N1 viruses to geese by contact with infected geese resulted in infection of all birds but limited signs of overt disease. In contrast, oral inoculation with high doses of Go/Gd-like viruses resulted in the deaths of up to 50% of infected geese. Transmission from infected geese to chickens occurred only by fecal contact, whereas transmission to quail occurred by either aerosol or fecal spread. This difference is probably explained by the higher susceptibility of quail to Go/Gd-like virus. The high degree of susceptibility of quail to Go/Gd (H5N1)-like viruses and the continued circulation of H6N1 and H9N2 viruses in quail support the hypothesis that quail were the host of origin of the H5N1/97 virus. The ease of transmission of Go/Gd (H5N1)-like viruses to land-based birds, especially quail, supports the wisdom of separating aquatic and land-based poultry in the markets in Hong Kong and the need for continued surveillance in the field and live-bird markets in which different types of poultry are in contact with one another.","2002-01","2016-01-12 07:40:29","2016-01-12 07:40:29","2016-01-12 07:40:29","118-126","","1","76","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 11739677 PMCID: PMC135698","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/TGHAMXWP/Webster et al. - 2002 - Characterization of H5N1 Influenza Viruses That Co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reliability of such predictions depends on a number of factors, including sample size, how far prediction locations are from the observed data, and similarity of predictive covariates in locations where data are gathered to locations where predictions are desired. In this paper, we propose extending Cook’s notion of an independent variable hull (IVH), developed originally for application with linear regression models, to generalized regression models as a way to help assess the potential reliability of predictions in unsampled areas. Predictions occurring inside the generalized independent variable hull (gIVH) can be regarded as interpolations, while predictions occurring outside the gIVH can be regarded as extrapolations worthy of additional investigation or skepticism. We conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the usefulness of this metric for limiting the scope of spatial inference when conducting model-based abundance estimation from survey counts. In this case, limiting inference to the gIVH substantially reduces bias, especially when survey designs are spatially imbalanced. We also demonstrate the utility of the gIVH in diagnosing problematic extrapolations when estimating the relative abundance of ribbon seals in the Bering Sea as a function of predictive covariates. We suggest that ecologists routinely use diagnostics such as the gIVH to help gauge the reliability of predictions from statistical models (such as generalized linear, generalized additive, and spatio-temporal regression models).","2015-10-23","2015-10-29 14:25:09","2015-10-29 14:25:09","2015-10-29 14:25:09","e0141416","","10","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/D59D9R4T/journal.pone.0141416.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These H5N1 viruses transmitted directly to humans from infected poultry. In the poultry markets in Hong Kong, both H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses were cocirculating, raising the possibility of genetic reassortment. Here we analyze the antigenic and genetic features of H9N2 influenza viruses with different epidemiological backgrounds. The results suggest that the H9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest three distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, six of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus—A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97)—suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants. The similarity of the internal genes of Qa/HK/G1/97 virus to those of the H5N1 influenza viruses suggests that the quail virus may have been the internal gene donor. Our findings indicate that the human and poultry H5N1 influenza viruses in Hong Kong in 1997 were reassortants that obtained internal gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97. However, we cannot be certain whether the replicate complex of H5N1 originated from Qa/HK/G1/97 or whether the reverse transfer occurred; the available evidence supports the former proposal.","1999-08-03","2016-01-12 07:41:20","2016-01-12 07:41:20","2016-01-12 07:41:20","9363-9367","","16","96","","PNAS","Molecular characterization of H9N2 influenza viruses","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 10430948","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7826IV8K/Guan et al. - 1999 - Molecular characterization of H9N2 influenza virus.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In June/July 2012, new HP H7N3 outbreaks occurred at commercial farms in Jalisco, Mexico. Outbreaks continued to be identified in neighbouring states in Mexico till August 2013. To explore the origin of this outbreak, time resolved phylogenetic trees were generated from the eight segments of full-length AIV sequences in North America using BEAST. Location, subtype, avian host species and pathogenicity were modelled as discrete traits upon the trees using continuous time Markov chains. A further joint analysis among segments was performed using a hierarchical phylogenetic model (HPM) which allowed trait rates (location, subtype, host species) to be jointly inferred across different segments. The complete spatial diffusion process was visualised through virtual globe software. Our result indicated the Mexico HP H7N3 originated from the large North America low pathogenicity AIV pool through complicated reassortment events. Different segments were contributed by wild waterfowl from different N. American flyways. Five of the eight segments (HA, NA, NP, M, NS) were introduced from wild birds migrating along the central North American flyway, and PB2, PB1 and PA were introduced via the western North American flyway. These results highlight a potential role for Mexico as a hotspot of virus reassortment as it is where wild birds from different migration routes mix during the winter.","2014-09-16","2015-11-05 02:29:11","2015-11-05 02:29:11","2015-11-05 02:29:11","e107330","","9","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/2SQMIQWC/Lu et al. - 2014 - Determining the Phylogenetic and Phylogeographic O.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The available information suggests that these viruses were generated by reassortment between a Mexican-like H5N2 virus and a local enzootic H6N1 virus. Yet the origin, prevalence, and pathogenicity of these H5N2 viruses have not been fully defined. Following the 2012 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, surveillance was conducted from December 2012 to July 2013 at a live-poultry wholesale market in Taipei. Our findings showed that H5N2 and H6N1 viruses cocirculated at low levels in chickens in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all H5N2 viruses had hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes derived from a 1994 Mexican-like virus, while their internal gene complexes were incorporated from the enzootic H6N1 virus lineage by multiple reassortment events. Pathogenicity studies demonstrated heterogeneous results even though all tested viruses had motifs (R-X-K/R-R) supportive of high pathogenicity. Serological surveys for common subtypes of avian viruses confirmed the prevalence of the H5N2 and H6N1 viruses in chickens and revealed an extraordinarily high seroconversion rate to an H9N2 virus, a subtype that is not found in Taiwan but is prevalent in mainland China. These findings suggest that reassortant H5N2 viruses, together with H6N1 viruses, have become established and enzootic in chickens throughout Taiwan and that a large-scale vaccination program might have been conducted locally that likely led to the introduction of the 1994 Mexican-like virus to Taiwan in 2003., IMPORTANCE H5N2 avian influenza viruses first appeared in chickens in Taiwan in 2003 and caused a series of outbreaks afterwards. Phylogenetic analyses show that the chicken H5N2 viruses have H5 and N2 genes that are closely related to those of a vaccine strain originating from Mexico in 1994, while the contemporary duck H5N2 viruses in Taiwan belong to the Eurasian gene pool. The unusually high similarity of the chicken H5N2 viruses to the Mexican vaccine strain suggests that these viruses might have been introduced to Taiwan by using inadequately inactivated or attenuated vaccines. These chicken H5N2 viruses are developing varying levels of pathogenicity that could lead to significant consequences for the local poultry industry. These findings emphasize the need for strict quality control and competent oversight in the manufacture and usage of avian influenza virus vaccines and indicate that alternatives to widespread vaccination may be desirable.","2014-05","2015-11-04 08:25:19","2015-11-04 08:25:19","2015-11-04 08:25:19","5677-5686","","10","88","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24623422 PMCID: PMC4019133","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/89PK2QBR/Lee et al. - 2014 - Emergence and Evolution of Avian H5N2 Influenza Vi.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019133/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty farms tested PCR positive for the presence of HPAI H5N2 between March and November 2011. Three HPAI H5N2 (AI2114, AI2214, AI2512) and 1 H1N2 (AI2887) viruses were isolated during this period, but H6N2 and H1N2 infections of ostriches were also confirmed by PCR. HPAI H5N2 isolate AI2114 produced an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) score of 1.37 in chickens whereas isolate AI2214 produced an IVPI score of 0.8. The former virus had an additional, predicted N-linked glycosylation site at position 88 of the hemagglutinin protein as well as an E627K mutation in the PB2 protein that was lacking from AI2214. Four variations at HA0 were detected in the PCR-positive cases. Phylogenetically, the branching order of outbreak strains indicated a lack of reassortment between outbreak strains that implied a single outbreak source and a wild duck origin for the progenitor outbreak strain. The 2011 outbreak strains had no genetic relationships to the previous 2004 and 2006 HPAI H5N2 outbreak viruses. Molecular clock analysis based on the N2 neuraminidase genes estimated a recent common ancestor for the outbreak tentatively dated at September 2010. Deep sequencing results of 16 clinical PCR-positive samples yielded data in the range of 573 to 12,590 base pairs (bp), with an average of 4468 bp of total genomic sequence recovered per sample. This data was used to confirm the lack ofreassortment and to assign samples into one of two epidemiologic groups to support epidemiologic tracing of the spread of the outbreak. One farm (no. 142), thought to have played a major epidemiologic role in the outbreak, was confirmed by deep sequencing to contain a mix of both epidemiologic virus groups.","2012-12","2015-11-03 07:09:40","2015-11-03 07:09:40","","865-879","","4 Suppl","56","","Avian Dis.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23402106","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23402106","","Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Struthioniformes; South Africa; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Molecular and phylogenetic characterization was performed to determine whether the outbreak strains were genetically derived from the supposedly eradicated Eastern Cape ostrich outbreak HPAI H5N2 strain of 2004. It was demonstrated that although the 2004 and 2006 South African H5N2 strains shared a common ancestor, the two outbreaks were not related. Not only were extensive reassortments with wild bird viruses involved in the evolution of the 2006 strains, but the precursor HA molecule HA₀ cleavage site sequence of the 2006 HPAI H5N2 virus also contained fewer basic amino-acid insertions. Multiple transmission events occurred from wild birds to ostriches in 2006, and it appears that a reservoir of H5N2 with pathogenic potential for poultry is established in the South African wild duck population.

Se demostró que aunque las cepas H5N2 Sudafricanas de los años 2004 y 2006 comparten un ancestro común, los dos brotes no estaban relacionados. En la evolución de las cepas del año 2006 no solo hubo recombinaciones extensas con aves silvestres, sino que la secuencia del sitio de corte del precursor HA₀ de la molécula de hemaglutinina del virus H5N2 de influenza aviar de alta patogenicidad del año 2006, también contenía menos inserciones de aminoácidos básicos. Múltiples situaciones de transmisión ocurrieron de las aves silvestres a los avestruces en el año 2006.

Here, we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of their viral genes, assessing their virulence in ducks and mice, and performing cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence analysis revealed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1–97.8% homology to A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus and that their NA genes showed 96.4–96.8% nucleotide identity to the NA gene of A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus, which belongs to the Eurasian lineage. Genotypic analysis indicated that these H5N5 viruses were multiple reassortants among H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, and H6N5 viruses. The analysis of HA clade showed that these H5N5 viruses are clustering into clade 2.3.4. In animal experiments, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% mortality in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the clade 2.3.2 avian influenza vaccine could provide only 75% protection with chickens against H5N5 virus challenge. Moreover, the H5N5 virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice, which suggested that the H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian hosts. Since ducks have served as reassortant vessels, playing pivotal roles in the generation of new subtypes of influenza viruses, it is important to monitor the emergence of this novel subtype of influenza viruses in waterfowl to understand their ecology and evolution and to control the spread of new viruses.","2013-12-27","2015-11-02 06:22:40","2015-11-02 06:22:40","2015-11-02 06:22:40","296-306","","3–4","167","","Veterinary Microbiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HDUQ8RV4/Liu et al. - 2013 - Emerging multiple reassortant H5N5 avian influenza.pdf","","","H5N5; Molecular and phylogenetic analysis; pathogenicity; Influenza virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human infections with HPAI H5N1 are of concern due to a high mortality rate and the potential for the emergence of pandemic viruses with sustained human-to-human transmission. Viruses isolated from humans in southern Vietnam have been classified as clade 1 with a single genome constellation (VN3) since their earliest detection in 2003. This is consistent with detection of this clade/genotype in poultry viruses endemic to the Mekong River Delta and surrounding regions. Comparison of H5N1 viruses detected in humans from southern Vietnamese provinces during 2012 and 2013 revealed the emergence of a 2013 reassortant virus with clade 1.1.2 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface protein genes but internal genes derived from clade 2.3.2.1a viruses (A/Hubei/1/2010-like; VN12). Closer analysis revealed mutations in multiple genes of this novel genotype (referred to as VN49) previously associated with increased virulence in animal models and other markers of adaptation to mammalian hosts. Despite the changes identified between the 2012 and 2013 genotypes analyzed, their virulence in a ferret model was similar. Antigenically, the 2013 viruses were less cross-reactive with ferret antiserum produced to the clade 1 progenitor virus, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, but reacted with antiserum produced against a new clade 1.1.2 WHO candidate vaccine virus (A/Cambodia/W0526301/2012) with comparable hemagglutination inhibition titers as the homologous antigen. Together, these results indicate changes to both surface and internal protein genes of H5N1 viruses circulating in southern Vietnam compared to 2012 and earlier viruses.","2015-08-05","2015-11-04 07:54:25","2015-11-04 07:54:25","2015-11-04 07:54:25","e0133867","","8","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WM22MAQQ/Thor et al. - 2015 - Detection and Characterization of Clade 1 Reassort.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have analyzed the evolution and pathogenicity of 4 H5N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from apparently healthy poultry from H5N1 virus endemic areas in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two of these viruses, A/duck/Eastern China/1111/2011 (DK/EC/1111/11) and A/goose/Eastern China/1112/2011 (GS/EC/1112/11) were derived from reassortment events in which clade 2.3.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses acquired novel neuraminidase and nonstructural protein genes. Another two isolates, A/chicken/Hebei/1102/2010 (CK/HB/1102/10) and A/duck/Hebei/0908/2009 (DK/HB/0908/09), possess hemagglutinin (HA) gene belong to clade 7 H5 viruses and other genes from endemic H9N2 viruses, or from viruses of various subtypes of the natural gene pool. All of these H5N2 isolates bear characteristic sequences of HPAI virus at the cleavage site of HA, and animal experiments indicated that all of these viruses but DK/HB/0908/09 is highly pathogenic to chickens. In particular, DK/EC/1111/11 and GS/EC/1112/11 are also highly pathogenic to ducks and moderately pathogenic to mice. All of these 4 viruses were able to replicate in domestic ducks and mice without prior adaptation. The emergence of these novel H5N2 viruses adds more evidence for the active evolution of H5 viruses in Asia. The maintenance of the highly pathogenic phenotype of some of these viruses even after reassortment with a new NA subtypes, their ability to replicate and transmit in domestic poultry, and the pathogenicity in the mammalian mouse model, highlight the potential threat posed by these viruses to both veterinary and public health.","2012-09-25","2015-11-04 11:59:56","2015-11-04 11:59:56","2015-11-04 11:59:56","e46183","","9","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7SRB66H3/Zhao et al. - 2012 - Novel Reassortant Highly Pathogenic H5N2 Avian Inf.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As of June 2008, Vietnam had reported nearly one third of worldwide laboratory confirmed human H5N1 infections. To better understand the emergence, spread and evolution of H5N1 in Vietnam we studied over 300 H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from Vietnam since their first detection in 2001. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that six genetically distinct H5N1 viruses were introduced into Vietnam during the past seven years. The H5N1 lineage that evolved following the introduction in 2003 of the A/duck/Hong Kong/821/2002-like viruses, with clade 1 hemagglutinin (HA), continued to predominate in southern Vietnam as of May 2007. A virus with a clade 2.3.4 HA newly introduced into northern Vietnam in 2007, reassorted with pre-existing clade 1 viruses, resulting in the emergence of novel genotypes with neuraminidase (NA) and/or internal gene segments from clade 1 viruses. A total of nine distinct genotypes have been present in Vietnam since 2001, including five that were circulating in 2007. At least four of these genotypes appear to have originated in Vietnam and represent novel H5N1 viruses not reported elsewhere. Geographic and temporal analyses of H5N1 infection dynamics in poultry suggest that the majority of viruses containing new genes were first detected in northern Vietnam and subsequently spread to southern Vietnam after reassorting with pre-existing local viruses in northern Vietnam. Although the routes of entry and spread of H5N1 in Vietnam remain speculative, enhanced poultry import controls and virologic surveillance efforts may help curb the entry and spread of new HPAI viral genes.","2008-10-21","2015-11-04 06:38:14","2015-11-04 06:38:14","2015-11-04 06:38:14","","","10","3","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 18941631 PMCID: PMC2565130","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FTPCWAVS/Wan et al. - 2008 - Evolution of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenz.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (refs 2–4) and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 (refs 5, 6). These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003–04. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable.

As we discover new methods and data sources suitable to track these events, it is not clear whether more information will lead to improved predictions. In the context of digital disease detection at the population level, we show that it is advantageous to combine the information from multiple flu activity predictors in the US instead of simply choosing the best performing flu predictor. Our findings suggest that the information from multiple data sources such as Google searches, Twitter microblogs, nearly real-time hospital visit records, and data from a participatory surveillance system, complement one another and produce the most accurate and robust set of flu predictions when combined optimally.","2015-10-29","2015-11-08 08:10:58","2015-11-08 08:10:58","2015-11-08 08:10:58","e1004513","","10","11","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XGBPHZ8W/Santillana et al. - 2015 - Combining Search, Social Media, and Traditional Da.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The highly dynamic nature of the air makes the selection of the best travel route difficult. We investigated to what extent migratory birds may optimise migratory route choice with respect to wind, and if route choice can be subject to natural selection. Following the optimal route, calculated using 21 years of empirical global wind data, reduced median travel time by 26.5% compared to the spatially shortest route. When we used a time-dependent survival model to quantify the adaptive benefit of choosing a fixed wind-optimised route, 84.8% of pairs of locations yielded a route with a higher survival than the shortest route. This suggests that birds, even if incapable of predicting wind individually, could adjust their migratory routes at a population level.

In this work we used a range of bioinformatics methods to analyze the Cambodian virus sequences together with those from neighboring countries. Six HA lineages belonging to clades 1 and 1.1 were identified since 2004. Lineage 1 shares an ancestor with viruses from Thailand and disappeared after 2005, to be replaced by lineage 2 originating from Vietnam and then by lineage 3. The highly adapted lineage 4 was seen only in Cambodia. Lineage 5 is circulating both in Vietnam and Cambodia since 2008 and was probably introduced in Cambodia through unregistered transboundary poultry trade. Lineage 6 is endemic to Cambodia since 2010 and could be classified as a new clade according to WHO/OIE/FAO criteria for H5N1 virus nomenclature. We propose to name it clade 1.1A. There is a direct filiation of lineages 2 to 6 with a temporal evolution and geographic differentiation for lineages 4 and 6. By the end of 2011, two lineages, i.e. lineages 5 and 6, with different transmission paths cocirculate in Cambodia. The presence of lineage 6 only in Cambodia suggests the existence of a transmission specific to this country whereas the presence of lineage 5 in both Cambodia and Vietnam indicates a distinct way of circulation of infected poultry.","2013-04","2015-11-13 04:16:47","2015-11-13 04:16:47","2015-11-13 04:16:47","87-94","","","15","","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","","Special Issue: IV International Giardia and Cryptosporidium Conference, Wellington, New Zealand - 2012The SISEA workshop (Surveillance and Investigation of Endemic Situations in South-East Asia)","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/AN6NFWJ7/Sorn et al. - 2013 - Dynamic of H5N1 virus in Cambodia and emergence of.pdf","","","Polymorphism; Cambodia; H5N1; Emergence; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In conjunction with other human activities, livestock production systems affect water, air and soil quality, global climate and biodiversity, altering the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. Here, we quantify the contribution of European livestock production to these major impacts. For each environmental effect, the contribution of livestock is expressed as shares of the emitted compounds and land used, as compared to the whole agricultural sector. The results show that the livestock sector contributes significantly to agricultural environmental impacts. This contribution is 78% for terrestrial biodiversity loss, 80% for soil acidification and air pollution (ammonia and nitrogen oxides emissions), 81% for global warming, and 73% for water pollution (both N and P). The agriculture sector itself is one of the major contributors to these environmental impacts, ranging between 12% for global warming and 59% for N water quality impact. Significant progress in mitigating these environmental impacts in Europe will only be possible through a combination of technological measures reducing livestock emissions, improved food choices and reduced food waste of European citizens.","2015","2015-11-15 17:30:46","2015-11-15 17:30:46","2015-11-15 17:30:46","115004","","11","10","","Environ.

Current approaches for predicting disease risks neglect key features of the landscape as components of the functional habitat of vectors or hosts, and hence of the pathogen. Empirical–statistical methods do not explicitly incorporate biological mechanisms, whereas current mechanistic models are rarely spatially explicit; both methods ignore the way animals use the landscape (i.e. movement ecology). We argue that applying a functional concept for habitat, i.e. the resource-based habitat concept (RBHC), can solve these issues. The RBHC offers a framework to identify systematically the different ecological resources that are necessary for the completion of the transmission cycle and to relate these resources to (combinations of) landscape features and other environmental factors. The potential of the RBHC as a framework for identifying suitable habitats for vector-borne pathogens is explored and illustrated with the case of bluetongue virus, a midge-transmitted virus affecting ruminants. The concept facilitates the study of functional habitats of the interacting species (vectors as well as hosts) and provides new insight into spatial and temporal variation in transmission opportunities and exposure that ultimately determine disease risks. It may help to identify knowledge gaps and control options arising from changes in the spatial configuration of key resources across the landscape. The RBHC framework may act as a bridge between existing mechanistic and statistical modelling approaches.","2014","2015-12-03 15:40:35","2015-12-03 15:40:35","2015-02-06 14:46:13","n/a-n/a","","","","","Biol Rev","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

In February 2003, an avian H5N1 virus closely related to one of these viruses was isolated from two humans with acute respiratory distress, one of whom died. Antigenic analysis of the new avian isolates showed a reactivity pattern different from that of H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997 and 2001. This finding suggests that significant antigenic variation has recently occurred among H5N1 viruses. We inoculated mallards with antigenically different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated between 1997 and 2003. The new 2002 avian isolates caused systemic infection in the ducks, with high virus titers and pathology in multiple organs, particularly the brain. Ducks developed acute disease, including severe neurological dysfunction and death. Virus was also isolated at high titers from the birds' drinking water and from contact birds, demonstrating efficient transmission. In contrast, H5N1 isolates from 1997 and 2001 were not consistently transmitted efficiently among ducks and did not cause significant disease. Despite a high level of genomic homology, the human isolate showed striking biological differences from its avian homologue in a duck model.

Serological studies indicated that H9N2 influenza viruses had infected a high proportion of chickens and other land-based birds (pigeon, pheasant, quail, guinea fowl, and chukka) from southeastern China. Two lineages of H9N2 influenza viruses present in the live-poultry markets were represented by A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97)-like and A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (Dk/HK/Y280/97)-like viruses. Up to 16% of cages of quail in the poultry markets contained Qa/HK/G1/97-like viruses, while about 5% of cages of other land-based birds were infected with Dk/HK/Y280/97-like viruses. No reassortant between the two H9N2 virus lineages was detected despite their cocirculation in the poultry markets. Reassortant viruses represented by A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 (H9N2) were the major H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in the Hong Kong markets in 1997 but have not been detected since the chicken slaughter in 1997. The Qa/HK/G1/97-like viruses were frequently isolated from quail, while Dk/HK/Y280/97-like viruses were predominately associated with chickens. The Qa/HK/G1/97-like viruses were evolving relatively rapidly, especially in their PB2, HA, NP, and NA genes, suggesting that they are in the process of adapting to a new host. Experimental studies showed that both H9N2 lineages were primarily spread by the aerosol route and that neither quail nor chickens showed evidence of disease. The high prevalence of quail infected with Qa/HK/G1/97-like virus that contains six gene segments genetically highly related to HK/156/97 (H5N1) virus emphasizes the need for surveillance of mammals including humans.","2000-10","2016-01-14 04:47:24","2016-01-14 04:47:24","2016-01-14 04:47:24","9372-9380","","20","74","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 11000205 PMCID: PMC112365","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZDAEZA5C/Guan et al. - 2000 - H9N2 Influenza Viruses Possessing H5N1-Like Intern.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During late April through June 2005, an outbreak of H5N1 virus infection occurred among wild birds at Qinghai Lake in China. Here, we describe the features of this outbreak. First identified in bar-headed geese, the disease soon spread to other avian species populating the lake. Sequence analysis of 15 viruses representing six avian species and collected at different times during the outbreak revealed four different H5N1 genotypes. Most of the isolates possessed lysine at position 627 in the PB2 protein, a residue known to be associated with virulence in mice and adaptation to humans. However, neither of the two index viruses possessed this residue. All of the viruses tested were pathogenic in mice, with the exception of one index virus. We also tested the replication of two viruses isolated during the Qinghai Lake outbreak and one unrelated duck H5N1 virus in rhesus macaques. The Qinghai Lake viruses did not replicate efficiently in these animals, producing no evidence of disease other than transient fever, while the duck virus replicated in multiple organs and caused symptoms of respiratory illness. Importantly, H5N1 viruses isolated in Mongolia, Russia, Inner Mongolia, and the Liaoning Province of China after August 2005 were genetically closely related to one of the genotypes isolated during the Qinghai outbreak, suggesting the dominant nature of this genotype and underscoring the need for worldwide intensive surveillance to minimize its devastating consequences.","2006-06","2016-01-20 03:54:51","2016-01-20 03:54:51","2016-01-20 03:54:51","5976-5983","","12","80","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 16731936 PMCID: PMC1472608","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GUR2R6A3/Chen et al. - 2006 - Properties and Dissemination of H5N1 Viruses Isola.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequence analysis of all eight genes of the LPAI virus and the HPAI viruses showed minor differences between the viruses except at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. The LPAI virus had a cleavage site similar to other low pathogenic H7 viruses, but the HPAI isolates had a 30 nucleotide insert. The insertion likely occurred by recombination between the HA and nucleoprotein genes of the LPAI virus, resulting in a virulence shift.

The first introduction of H7N3 AIV to Pakistan occurred during 1995, since then H7N3, H9N2 and H5N1 AIVs have each been sporadically isolated. This report evaluates the genetic origin of the H7N3 viruses from Pakistan collected 1995-2004 and how they disseminated within the country. To accomplish this we produced whole genome sequences for 6 H7N3 viruses and data for the HA and NA genes of an additional 7 isolates. All available sequence from H7N3 AIV from Pakistan was included in the analysis. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there were two introductions of H7 into Pakistan and one N3 introduction. Only one of the H7 introductions appears to have become established in poultry in Pakistan, while the other was isolated from two separate outbreaks 6 years apart. The data also shows that reassortment has occurred between H7N3 and H9N2 viruses in the field, likely during co-infection of poultry. Also, with the exception of these few reassortant isolates, all 8 genes in the predominant H7N3 virus lineage have evolved to be phylogenetically distinct. Conclusions Although rigorous control measures have been implemented in commercial poultry in Pakistan, AIV is sporadically transmitted to poultry and among the different poultry industry compartments (broilers, broiler breeders, table egg layers). Since there is one primary H7 lineage which persists and that has reassorted with the H9N2 AIV in poultry, it suggests that there is a reservoir with some link commercial poultry. On a general level, this offers insight into the molecular ecology of AIV in poultry where the virus has persisted despite vaccination and biosecurity. This data also illustrates the importance of sustained surveillance for AIVs in poultry.","2010-06-24","2016-01-22 09:05:24","2016-01-22 09:05:24","2016-01-22 09:05:24","1-10","","1","7","","Virol J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/8DE9HUCU/Abbas et al. - 2010 - Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of H7N3 avian i.pdf","","","Virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral genes showed that the H5N1 poultry isolates from South Korea were of avian origin and contained the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/Gd) lineage. The current H5N1 strains in Asia, including the Korean isolates, share a gene constellation similar to that of the Penfold Park, Hong Kong, isolates from late 2002 and contain some molecular markers that seem to have been fixed in the Gs/Gd lineage virus since 2001. However, despite genetic similarities among recent H5N1 isolates, the topology of the phylogenetic tree clearly differentiates the Korean isolates from the Vietnamese and Thai isolates which have been reported to infect humans. A representative Korean isolate was inoculated into mice, with no mortality and no virus being isolated from the brain, although high titers of virus were observed in the lungs. The same isolate, however, caused systemic infections in chickens and quail and killed all of the birds within 2 and 4 days of intranasal inoculation, respectively. This isolate also replicated in multiple organs and tissues of ducks and caused some mortality. However, lower virus titers were observed in all corresponding tissues of ducks than in chicken and quail tissues, and the histological lesions were restricted to the respiratory tract. This study characterizes the molecular and biological properties of the H5N1 HPAI viruses from South Korea and emphasizes the need for comparative analyses of the H5N1 isolates from different countries to help elucidate the risk of a human pandemic from the strains of H5N1 HPAI currently circulating in Asia.","2005-03","2016-01-19 07:58:35","2016-01-19 07:58:35","2016-01-19 07:58:35","3692-3702","","6","79","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 15731263 PMCID: PMC1075707","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/IWCD5SP5/Lee et al. - 2005 - Characterization of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian I.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, integration of information such as agroecological farming system characteristics can provide new knowledge on risk factors of influenza emergence and spread. Integrating viral characteristics into an animal disease information system is therefore expected to provide a unique tool to trace-and-track particular virus strains; generate clade distributions and spatiotemporal clusters; screen for distribution of viruses with specific molecular markers; identify potential risk factors; and analyze or map viral characteristics related to vaccines used for control and/or prevention. For this purpose, a genetic module was developed within EMPRES-i (FAO’s global animal disease information system) linking epidemiological information from influenza events with virus characteristics and enabling combined analysis. An algorithm was developed to act as the interface between EMPRES-i disease event data and publicly available influenza virus sequences in OpenfluDB. This algorithm automatically computes potential links between outbreak event and sequences, which are subsequently manually validated by experts. Subsequently, other virus characteristics such as antiviral resistance can then be associated to outbreak data. To visualize such characteristics on a geographic map, shape files with virus characteristics to overlay on other EMPRES-i map layers (e.g. animal densities) can be generated. The genetic module allows export of associated epidemiological and sequence data for further analysis. FAO has made this tool available for scientists and policy makers. Contributions are expected from users to improve and validate the number of linked influenza events and isolate information as well as the quality of information.

In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to ""spatial sorting bias"": the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45% and better than Bioclim for 67% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence-absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.","2012-03","2016-03-03 06:03:19","2016-03-03 06:03:19","","679-688","","3","93","","Ecology","Cross-validation of species distribution models","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22624221","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/X9CTHAUM/Hijmans 2012.pdf","","","Computer Simulation; Demography; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Species Specificity; animals; climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From 2000 onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1 viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in Eurasia.","2007-07-15","2016-02-13 05:36:34","2016-02-13 05:36:34","2016-02-13 05:36:34","7529-7539","","14","81","","J.

Animal and human health are increasingly interlinked through emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance. In many developing countries, the rapidity of change has also had social impacts with increased risk of marginalisation of smallholder farmers. However, both the impacts and benefits of livestock farming often differ between extensive (backyard farming mostly for home-consumption) and intensive, commercial production systems (larger herd or flock size, higher investments in inputs, a tendency towards market-orientation). A density of 10,000 chickens per km2 has different environmental, epidemiological and societal implications if these birds are raised by 1,000 individual households or in a single industrial unit. Here, we introduce a novel relationship that links the national proportion of extensively raised animals to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in purchasing power parity). This relationship is modelled and used together with the global distribution of rural population to disaggregate existing 10 km resolution global maps of chicken and pig distributions into extensive and intensive systems. Our results highlight countries and regions where extensive and intensive chicken and pig production systems are most important. We discuss the sources of uncertainties, the modelling assumptions and ways in which this approach could be developed to forecast future trajectories of intensification.","2015-07-31","2016-02-14 06:58:07","2016-02-14 06:58:07","2016-02-14 06:58:07","e0133381","","7","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WJGZGNJC/Gilbert et al. - 2015 - Income Disparities and the Global Distribution of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) H5N1 have caused many outbreaks in poultries and wild birds from East Asia and have spread to at least 48 countries. For such a fast and wide-spreading virulent pathogen, prediction based on changes of micro- and macro-environment has rarely been evaluated. In this study, we are developing a new climatic approach by investigating the conditions that occurred before the H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results show a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China's Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1. Weather monitoring could play an important role in the early warning of outbreaks of this potentially dangerous virus.","2007-02-07","2016-02-15 05:03:22","2016-02-15 05:03:22","2016-02-15 05:03:22","e191","","2","2","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FUQV2JAZ/Liu et al. - 2007 - Temperature Drops and the Onset of Severe Avian In.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basis for this pronounced seasonality is not understood, nor is it well documented how influenza A transmission principally occurs. Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects both influenza virus transmission (IVT) and influenza virus survival (IVS). Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of absolute humidity on IVT and IVS. We find that absolute humidity (AH) constrains both transmission efficiency and IVS much more significantly than RH. In the studies presented, 50% of IVT variability and 90% of IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, respectively, only 12% and 36% are explained by RH. In temperate regions, both outdoor and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal cycle that minimizes in winter. This seasonal cycle is consistent with a wintertime increase in IVS and IVT and may explain the seasonality of influenza. Thus, differences in AH provide a single, coherent, more physically sound explanation for the observed variability of IVS, IVT and influenza seasonality in temperate regions. This hypothesis can be further tested through future, additional laboratory, epidemiological and modeling studies.","2009-03-03","2016-02-15 05:15:11","2016-02-15 05:15:11","2016-02-15 05:15:11","3243-3248","","9","106","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 19204283","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/2JHJKWCZ/Shaman and Kohn - 2009 - Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, tr.pdf","","","aerosol; droplet nuclei; vapor pressure; virus survival","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1-km resolution global product that provides scale-integrated and accuracy-weighted consensus land-cover information on an approximately continuous scale. Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.","2014-09-01","2016-02-15 03:09:27","2016-02-15 03:09:27","2016-02-15 03:09:27","1031-1045","","9","23","","Global Ecology and Biogeography","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","","Remote sensing; species distribution models; DISCover; GLC2000; GlobCover; land-cover heterogeneity; land-cover prevalence; MODIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The largest recorded outbreak of EVD is ongoing in West Africa, outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976–2014). Using species distribution models, these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however, the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04395.001, Since the first outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976, there have been numerous other outbreaks in humans across Africa with fatality rates ranging from 50% to 90%. Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal. The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild., The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined. The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus., Pigott et al. have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible. As such, the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak. The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources. The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years. The maps, which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions, also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats., Pigott et al. report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk. However, outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low. The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another, so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks. As more people live in, and travel to and from, the at-risk regions than ever before, Pigott et al. note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04395.002","2014-09-08","2016-03-03 07:42:35","2016-03-03 07:42:35","2016-03-03 07:42:35","","","","3","","eLife","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25201877 PMCID: PMC4166725","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/UWM3SRDA/Pigott et al. - 2014 - Mapping the zoonotic niche of Ebola virus disease .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we outline approaches to developing a new high resolution population distribution dataset for Africa and analyse rural accessibility to population centers. Contemporary population count data were combined with detailed satellite-derived settlement extents to map population distributions across Africa at a finer spatial resolution than ever before. Substantial heterogeneity in settlement patterns, population concentration and spatial accessibility to major population centres is exhibited across the continent. In Africa, 90% of the population is concentrated in less than 21% of the land surface and the average per-person travel time to settlements of more than 50,000 inhabitants is around 3.5 hours, with Central and East Africa displaying the longest average travel times.

With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 5×5 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed sub-national livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced.","2014-05-29","2016-02-14 07:04:46","2016-02-14 07:04:46","2016-02-14 07:04:46","e96084","","5","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/CPZBWQXP/Robinson et al. - 2014 - Mapping the Global Distribution of Livestock.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ex ante analysis framework was applied to identify the location of areas with high probability of HPAI H5N1 occurrence for the alternative vaccination program by using boosted regression trees (BRT) models, followed by weighted overlay operations. Cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programs was then estimated to measure the tradeoff between the past national poultry vaccination program and the alternative vaccination program. Ex ante analysis showed that the focus areas for the alternative vaccination program included 1137 communes, corresponding to 50.6% of total communes in the Delta, and located primarily in the coastal areas to the east and south of Hanoi.

We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species’ distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species’ occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species’ distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods.

The immediate precursor of these HPAI viruses is believed to be A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD)-like H5N1 HPAI viruses first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996. From 2000 onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1 viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in Eurasia.","2007-07-15","2016-02-13 05:37:00","2016-02-13 05:37:00","2016-02-13 05:37:00","7529-7539","","14","81","","J.

The Southeast Asia region has undergone rapid urbanization and population growth over the past decade, yet existing spatial population distribution datasets covering the region are based principally on population count data from censuses circa 2000, with often insufficient spatial resolution or input data to map settlements precisely. Here we outline approaches to construct a database of GIS-linked circa 2010 census data and methods used to construct fine-scale (∼100 meters spatial resolution) population distribution datasets for each country in the Southeast Asia region. Landsat-derived settlement maps and land cover information were combined with ancillary datasets on infrastructure to model population distributions for 2010 and 2015. These products were compared with those from two other methods used to construct commonly used global population datasets. Results indicate mapping accuracies are consistently higher when incorporating land cover and settlement information into the AsiaPop modelling process. Using existing data, it is possible to produce detailed, contemporary and easily updatable population distribution datasets for Southeast Asia.

Time series of data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites offer the potential to capture environmental thermal and vegetation seasonality, through temporal Fourier analysis, more accurately than was previously possible using the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data. MODIS data are composited over 8- or 16-day time intervals that pose unique problems for temporal Fourier analysis. Applying standard techniques to MODIS data can introduce errors of up to 30% in the estimation of the amplitudes and phases of the Fourier harmonics.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe present a novel spline-based algorithm that overcomes the processing problems of composited MODIS data. The algorithm is tested on artificial data generated using randomly selected values of both amplitudes and phases, and provides an accurate estimate of the input variables under all conditions. The algorithm was then applied to produce layers that capture the seasonality in MODIS data for the period from 2001 to 2005.Conclusions/SignificanceGlobal temporal Fourier processed images of 1 km MODIS data for Middle Infrared Reflectance, day- and night-time Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are presented for ecological and epidemiological applications. The finer spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the greater geolocational and spectral accuracy of the MODIS instruments, compared with previous multi-temporal data sets, mean that these data may be used with greater confidence in species' distribution modelling.","2008-01-09","2016-02-15 03:34:00","2016-02-15 03:34:00","2016-02-15 03:34:00","e1408","","1","3","","PLoS ONE","Global Data for Ecology and Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/DDMGP52I/Scharlemann et al. - 2008 - Global Data for Ecology and Epidemiology A Novel .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monitoring the transmissibility of pathogens from the animal reservoir in humans is key for early detection of epidemic spread, and for effective control. Here we have used data from a small but well-defined study of H7N7 avian influenza virus transmission in human households to estimate the transmissibility of H7N7 avian influenza in humans living in close contact. The analyses make use of household final size data (i.e., the number of individuals in the household who are ultimately infected), which, for many pathogens, are easily collected. For the H7N7 data, the analyses indicate that the transmission chain in humans may well have extended beyond the first generation of infections in humans, and that less than half of the household infections could have been prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. Our method of analysis provides a rapid and generally applicable tool that can be used to monitor emerging human transmissibility of pathogens from the animal reservoir.</p></sec>","2007-07-27","2015-09-15 11:27:02","2015-09-15 11:27:02","2013-04-22 15:20:10","e145","","7","3","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/C4T3ANFA/van Boven et al. - 2007 - Detecting Emerging Transmissibility of Avian Influ.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WTRNQHEZ/t.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a longitudinal study, monitoring ducks and in-contact chickens in 80 flocks in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam with bi-monthly testing from May 2007 until May 2008. Because H5 vaccination campaigns are conducted at regular intervals in poultry flocks in Viet Nam, both unvaccinated sentinel and H5 vaccinates were monitored. On each farm, a total of 10 birds were selected: 7 ducks (4 unvaccinated and 3 vaccinated) and 3 chickens (2 unvaccinated and 1 vaccinated) that were in close contact with the ducks. Blood samples were tested for H5 antibodies using the hemagglutination inhibition test, with H5 antibody titers â‰¥24 considered to indicate past exposure to H5 field or vaccine virus. Titers of vaccinated birds were analyzed for samples collected more than 3 weeks post-vaccination. Pooled oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were assessed for H5 viral RNA using real-time PCR. Bird- and flock-level prevalences were estimated accounting for sampling fractions and clustering under the multi-stage sampling design with birds being sampled within flocks within villages in four different provinces. In total, serum and swab samples from 5409 birds-samplings were analyzed. Bird-level seroprevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 14.1, 20.9) amongst unvaccinated ducks and 10.7% (95% CI: 7.4, 14.4) amongst unvaccinated in-contact chickens. Flock-level seroprevalence (proportion of flock-visits with at least one unvaccinated bird test positive) was 42.6% (95% CI: 38.0, 47.2) for ducks and 19.0% (95% CI: 13.6, 24.4) for chickens. Only 54.3% (95% CI: 39.2, 69.3) of vaccinated ducks and 55.5% (95% CI: 46.8, 64.2) of vaccinated in-contact chickens had H5 antibodies at more than 3 weeks post-vaccination. At about 40% and 48% of flock-visits, less than 50% of sampled vaccinated ducks and chickens, respectively, had positive titers. The flock-level virus prevalence (proportion of flocks with at least one bird positive for H5 virus of the vaccinated and unvaccinated birds tested) was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1). No HPAI outbreaks or mortality suspected to be due to HPAI occurred in study flocks during the observation period. Our results indicate that a substantial proportion of ducks and in-contact chickens were exposed to H5 virus during the study period. In the face of this widespread exposure to H5 virus, and despite only moderate proportions of birds developing positive titers post-vaccination, flocks were not affected by HPAI outbreaks during our study period. The higher bird-level seroprevalence in ducks compared to in-contact chickens may be due to greater durations of antibody persistence in ducks or greater rates of H5 virus exposure. These findings indicate that ducks are potentially an important source of H5 virus for other bird species.","2011-09-01","2015-09-15 12:27:24","2015-09-15 12:27:24","2011-09-20 09:00:01","229-240","","3-4","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Poultry; Prevalence; Viet Nam; duck; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9, and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from human-infective A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds α-2,3 sialic acid but not α-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry. , IMPORTANCE This investigation confirms that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes and is totally different from the H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus acquired a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting subtype H7N9 but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet. It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.","2015-06-17","2016-03-26 14:29:13","2016-03-26 14:29:13","2016-03-26 14:29:13","8806-8815","","17","89","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26085150 PMCID: PMC4524050","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XVCWAWC6/Yu et al. - 2015 - Newly Emergent Highly Pathogenic H5N9 Subtype Avia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infection with HPAI caused significant morbidity and mortality in chickens, while in ducks the infection was asymptomatic. The HPAI viral mRNA load was higher in all investigated tissues of chickens compared with duck tissues. In the lung, brain and spleen of HPAI-infected chickens, a high, but delayed, pro-inflammatory response of IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA was induced, including up-regulation of IFN-β, IFN-γ, TLR3 and MDA-5 mRNA from 1 day post infection (p.i.). Whereas in ducks already at 8 h p.i., a quicker but lower response was found for IL-6, IL-1β and iNOS mRNA followed by a delayed activation of TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5 and IFN-γ mRNA response. Virus-infected areas in the lung of chickens co-localized with KUL-01+ (macrophages, dendritic cells), CD4+, and CD8α+ cells, during the first day after infection. However, only KUL-01+ cells co-localized with the virus after 1 day p.i. In ducks, CVI-ChNL-68.1+ (macrophage-like cells), CD4+ and CD8α+ cells and apoptosis co-localized with the virus within 8 h p.i. Apoptosis was detected in the brain and lung of HPAI-infected chickens after 2 days p.i. and apoptotic cells co-localized with virus-infected areas. In conclusion, excessive delayed cytokine inflammatory responses but inadequate cellular immune responses may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, while ducks initiate a fast lower cytokine response followed by the activation of major pattern recognition receptors (TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5) and a persistent cellular response.","2013-08-01","2016-04-12 03:13:11","2016-04-12 03:13:11","2016-04-12 03:13:11","347-364","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","PMID: 23782222","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QJA7MI4N/Cornelissen et al. - 2013 - Differences in highly pathogenic avian influenza v.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is know of its distribution in China where HPAI H5N1 first emerged in 1996, evolved, and spread throughout Asia and the western Palearctic in 2004–2006. This study analyzes separately the distribution, in domestic poultry, of HPAI virus (HPAIV) H5N1 isolated from active risk-based surveillance sampling and HPAI H5N1 clinical disease outbreaks. These data are analyzed in relation to the distribution of chicken and domestic waterfowl population density, proportion of land covered by rice or surface water, cropping intensity, elevation, and human population density. HPAI H5N1 viruses identified by risk-based surveillance are found to be associated with domestic waterfowl density, human population density, and the proportion of land covered by surface water. In contrast, HPAI H5N1 clinical disease outbreak occurrences were mainly associated with chicken density, human population density, and low elevation. These results show that the distribution of HPAI H5N1 risk in China appears more limited geographically than previously assessed, offering prospects for better targeted surveillance and control interventions.","2011-03-03","2016-04-11 04:23:20","2016-04-11 04:23:20","2016-04-11 04:23:20","e1001308","","3","7","","PLOS Pathog","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MDHRQZD6/Martin et al. - 2011 - Spatial Distribution and Risk Factors of Highly Pa.pdf","","","Chickens; China; H5N1; Population Density; Poultry; Disease surveillance; Infectious disease control; Infectious disease surveillance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A newly emerged HPAI A(H5N8) virus caused poultry outbreaks in the Republic of Korea in 2014. Because newly emerging high-pathogenicity H5 viruses continue to pose public health risks, it is imperative that their pathobiological properties be examined. Here, we characterized A/mallard duck/Korea/W452/2014 (MDk/W452(H5N8)), a representative virus, and evaluated its pathogenic and pandemic potential in various animal models. We found that MDk/W452(H5N8), which originated from the reassortment of wild bird viruses harbored by migratory waterfowl in eastern China, replicated systemically and was lethal in chickens, but appeared to be attenuated, albeit efficiently transmitted, in ducks. Despite predominant attachment to avian-like virus receptors, MDk/W452(H5N8) also exhibited detectable human virus-like receptor binding and replicated in human respiratory tract tissues. In mice, MDk/W452(H5N8) was moderately pathogenic and had limited tissue tropism relative to previous HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. It also induced moderate nasal wash titers in inoculated ferrets; additionally, it was recovered in extrapulmonary tissues and one of three direct-contact ferrets seroconverted without shedding. Moreover, domesticated cats appeared to be more susceptible than dogs to virus infection. With their potential to become established in ducks, continued circulation of A(H5N8) viruses could alter the genetic evolution of pre-existing avian poultry strains. Overall, detailed virological investigation remains a necessity given the capacity of H5 viruses to evolve to cause human illness with few changes in the viral genome.","2014-10-22","2016-04-12 03:04:32","2016-04-12 03:04:32","2016-04-12 03:04:32","e75","","10","3","","Emerg Microbes Infect","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BA9JZB49/Kim et al. - 2014 - Pathobiological features of a novel, highly pathog.pdf","","","Reassortment; migratory waterfowl; Avian influenza virus; HPAI A(H5N8); genetic evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies to understand the infectivity and transmissibility of an H5N8 and H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses in chickens, turkeys and Japanese quail were undertaken. Chickens and Japanese quail were frequently listless and had ruffled feathers before death, but a few had neurological signs. Pancreatic necrosis, splenomegaly, renomegaly and petechial hemorrhages on myocardium were the most common lesions in birds that died. However, some chickens also had cyanosis of combs and wattles. Neurological signs were the primary presentation of disease in turkeys. The mean death time in all species was late (3-9 days post exposure) when compared to H5N1 HPAIV (2-3 days). Infection lead to death as survivors lacked H5 hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies. However, neither virus appeared to be well adapted to chickens or turkeys and required a dose of 6log10 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) per bird to achieve 50% infection and did not transmit to contact exposure birds. Quail were slightly more susceptible with a 50% infectious dose of 4 log10 EID50 per bird for each isolate. These results suggest the intercontinental H5N8 and H5N2 HPAIV have reduced virulence and transmissibility for gallinaceous host compared to historical H5N1 HPAIV.","","2016-04-12 03:35:36","2016-04-12 03:38:00","2016-04-12 03:35:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4WMV6JJU/publications.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Projected summer population depressions as a result of increased immature mortality and habitat drying are most severe in the south and almost absent further north; extended spring and fall survival is ubiquitous. Much of California also exhibits a bimodal pattern. Projected onset of mosquito season is delayed in the southwestern United States because of extremely dry and hot spring and summers; however, increased temperature and late summer and fall rains extend the mosquito season. These results are unique in being a broad-scale calculation of the projected impacts of climate change on a WNV vector.

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km 2 ). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations.","2016-03-15","2016-04-13 13:06:38","2016-04-13 13:06:38","2016-04-13 13:06:38","e0150424","","3","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MKZMMVWR/Nicolas et al. - 2016 - Using Random Forest to Improve the Downscaling of .pdf","","mapping-livestock; map-people-livestock","Census; Africa; Cattle; Chickens; Machine learning; Asia; Livestock; Farms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have analyzed the evolution and pathogenicity of 4 H5N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from apparently healthy poultry from H5N1 virus endemic areas in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two of these viruses, A/duck/Eastern China/1111/2011 (DK/EC/1111/11) and A/goose/Eastern China/1112/2011 (GS/EC/1112/11) were derived from reassortment events in which clade 2.3.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses acquired novel neuraminidase and nonstructural protein genes. Another two isolates, A/chicken/Hebei/1102/2010 (CK/HB/1102/10) and A/duck/Hebei/0908/2009 (DK/HB/0908/09), possess hemagglutinin (HA) gene belong to clade 7 H5 viruses and other genes from endemic H9N2 viruses, or from viruses of various subtypes of the natural gene pool. All of these H5N2 isolates bear characteristic sequences of HPAI virus at the cleavage site of HA, and animal experiments indicated that all of these viruses but DK/HB/0908/09 is highly pathogenic to chickens. In particular, DK/EC/1111/11 and GS/EC/1112/11 are also highly pathogenic to ducks and moderately pathogenic to mice. All of these 4 viruses were able to replicate in domestic ducks and mice without prior adaptation. The emergence of these novel H5N2 viruses adds more evidence for the active evolution of H5 viruses in Asia. The maintenance of the highly pathogenic phenotype of some of these viruses even after reassortment with a new NA subtypes, their ability to replicate and transmit in domestic poultry, and the pathogenicity in the mammalian mouse model, highlight the potential threat posed by these viruses to both veterinary and public health.","2012-09-25","2016-04-14 03:47:08","2016-04-14 03:47:08","2016-04-14 03:47:08","e46183","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZS5AWNXW/Zhao et al. - 2012 - Novel Reassortant Highly Pathogenic H5N2 Avian Inf.pdf","","","Chickens; Ducks; H5N1; Phylogenetic analysis; Poultry; Pathogenesis; Influenza viruses; Viral pathogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animal and human health are increasingly interlinked through emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance. In many developing countries, the rapidity of change has also had social impacts with increased risk of marginalisation of smallholder farmers. However, both the impacts and benefits of livestock farming often differ between extensive (backyard farming mostly for home-consumption) and intensive, commercial production systems (larger herd or flock size, higher investments in inputs, a tendency towards market-orientation). A density of 10,000 chickens per km 2  has different environmental, epidemiological and societal implications if these birds are raised by 1,000 individual households or in a single industrial unit. Here, we introduce a novel relationship that links the national proportion of extensively raised animals to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in purchasing power parity). This relationship is modelled and used together with the global distribution of rural population to disaggregate existing 10 km resolution global maps of chicken and pig distributions into extensive and intensive systems. Our results highlight countries and regions where extensive and intensive chicken and pig production systems are most important. We discuss the sources of uncertainties, the modelling assumptions and ways in which this approach could be developed to forecast future trajectories of intensification.","2015-07-31","2016-04-20 08:34:39","2016-04-20 08:34:39","2016-04-20 08:34:39","e0133381","","7","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.plos.org","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/P8QPB4N4/Gilbert et al. - 2015 - Income Disparities and the Global Distribution of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We compared the characteristics of sporadic and clustered cases of human H5N1 and H7N9 infection, estimated the relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts, and the reproduction number (R). RESULTS: We assembled and analyzed data on 720 H5N1 cases and 460 H7N9 cases up to 2 November 2014. The severity and average age of sporadic/index cases of H7N9 was greater than secondary cases (71% requiring intensive care unit admission vs 33%, P = .007; median age 59 years vs 31, P < .001). We observed no significant differences in the age and severity between sporadic/index and secondary H5N1 cases. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for R was 0.12 for H5N1 and 0.27 for H7N9. A higher proportion of H5N1 infections occurred in clusters (20%) compared to H7N9 (8%). The relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts of cases compared to unrelated contacts was 8.96 for H5N1 (95% CI, 1.30, 61.86) and 0.80 for H7N9 (95% CI, .32, 1.97). CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with an ascertainment bias towards severe and older cases for sporadic H7N9 but not for H5N1. The lack of evidence for ascertainment bias in sporadic H5N1 cases, the more pronounced clustering of cases, and the higher risk of infection in blood-related contacts, support the hypothesis that susceptibility to H5N1 may be limited and familial. This analysis suggests the potential pandemic risk may be greater for H7N9 than H5N1.","2015-08-15","2016-04-22 07:08:54","2016-04-22 07:08:54","","563-571","","4","61","","Clin. Infect.

Live poultry markets, density of human, coverage of built-up land, relative humidity and precipitation were significant predictors for both. In addition, density of poultry, coverage of shrub and temperature played important roles for human H7N9 infection, whereas human H5N1 infection was associated with coverage of forest and water body. Based on the risks and distribution of ecological characteristics which may facilitate the circulation of the two viruses, we found Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, along with a few spots on the southeast coastline, to be the high risk areas for H7N9 and H5N1. Additional, H5N1 risk spots were identified in eastern Sichuan and southern Yunnan Provinces.

Great efforts in control and prevention of the disease, including universal vaccination campaigns in poultry and active serological and virological surveillance, have been undertaken in mainland China since the beginning of 2006. In this study, we aim to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of HPAI H5N1, and identify influencing factors favoring the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in mainland China. Our study shows that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks took place sporadically after vaccination campaigns in poultry, and mostly occurred in the cold season. The positive tests in routine virological surveillance of HPAI H5N1 virus in chicken, duck, goose as well as environmental samples were mapped to display the potential risk distribution of the virus. Southern China had a higher positive rate than northern China, and positive samples were mostly detected from chickens in the north, while the majority were from duck in the south, and a negative correlation with monthly vaccination rates in domestic poultry was found (R = -0.19, p value = 0.005). Multivariate panel logistic regression identified vaccination rate, interaction between distance to the nearest city and national highway, interaction between distance to the nearest lake and wetland, and density of human population, as well as the autoregressive term in space and time as independent risk factors in the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, based on which a predicted risk map of the disease was derived. Our findings could provide new understanding of the distribution and transmission of HPAI H5N1 in mainland China and could be used to inform targeted surveillance and control efforts in both human and poultry populations to reduce the risk of future infections.","2015-05","2016-04-22 07:29:03","2016-04-22 07:29:03","","5026-5045","","5","12","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26006118 PMCID: PMC4454952","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26006118","","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza; China; H5N1; Public Health; GIS; risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, integration of information such as agroecological farming system characteristics can provide new knowledge on risk factors of influenza emergence and spread. Integrating viral characteristics into an animal disease information system is therefore expected to provide a unique tool to trace-and-track particular virus strains; generate clade distributions and spatiotemporal clusters; screen for distribution of viruses with specific molecular markers; identify potential risk factors; and analyze or map viral characteristics related to vaccines used for control and/or prevention. For this purpose, a genetic module was developed within EMPRES-i (FAO's global animal disease information system) linking epidemiological information from influenza events with virus characteristics and enabling combined analysis. An algorithm was developed to act as the interface between EMPRES-i disease event data and publicly available influenza virus sequences in OpenfluDB. This algorithm automatically computes potential links between outbreak event and sequences, which are subsequently manually validated by experts. Subsequently, other virus characteristics such as antiviral resistance can then be associated to outbreak data. To visualize such characteristics on a geographic map, shape files with virus characteristics to overlay on other EMPRES-i map layers (e.g. animal densities) can be generated. The genetic module allows export of associated epidemiological and sequence data for further analysis. FAO has made this tool available for scientists and policy makers. Contributions are expected from users to improve and validate the number of linked influenza events and isolate information as well as the quality of information. Possibilities to interconnect with other influenza sequence databases or to expand the genetic module to other viral diseases (e.g. foot and mouth disease) are being explored.

Populations exhibited density-dependent positive feedback between 1960 and 2010, and a long-term positive correlation between agricultural activity and population size, which has resulted in a free-scale population distribution that has been disrupted by the collapse of the traditional agricultural society and by emigration to the industrialized cities.

A more consistent use of socio-economic scenarios that would allow an integrated perspective on mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts remains a major challenge. We assert that the identification of a set of global narratives and socio-economic pathways offering scalability to different regional contexts, a reasonable coverage of key socio-economic dimensions and relevant futures, and a sophisticated approach to separating climate policy from counter-factual “no policy” scenarios would be an important step toward meeting this challenge. To this end, we introduce the concept of “shared socio-economic (reference) pathways”. Sufficient coverage of the relevant socio-economic dimensions may be achieved by locating the pathways along the dimensions of challenges to mitigation and to adaptation. The pathways should be specified in an iterative manner and with close collaboration between integrated assessment modelers and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers to assure coverage of key dimensions, sufficient scalability and widespread adoption. They can be used not only as inputs to analyses, but also to collect the results of different climate change analyses in a matrix defined by two dimensions: climate exposure as characterized by a radiative forcing or temperature level and socio-economic development as classified by the pathways. For some applications, socio-economic pathways may have to be augmented by “shared climate policy assumptions” capturing global components of climate policies that some studies may require as inputs. We conclude that the development of shared socio-economic (reference) pathways, and integrated socio-economic scenarios more broadly, is a useful focal point for collaborative efforts between integrated assessment and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers.","2012-10","2016-06-03 07:12:17","2016-06-03 07:12:17","2016-06-03 07:12:17","807-822","","4","22","","Global Environmental Change","The need for and use of socio-economic scenarios for climate change analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","climate change; Impact; Adaptation; Vulnerability; Socio-economic scenario; Integrated assessment modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urbanization is a key aspect of development that is relevant to studies of mitigation, adaptation, and impacts. Incorporating urbanization into the SSPs requires a consistent set of global urbanization projections that cover long time horizons and span a full range of uncertainty. Existing urbanization projections do not meet these needs, in particular providing only a single scenario over the next few decades, a period during which urbanization is likely to be highly dynamic in many countries. We present here a new, long-term, global set of urbanization projections at country level that cover a plausible range of uncertainty. We create SSP-specific projections by choosing urbanization outcomes consistent with each SSP narrative. Results show that the world continues to urbanize in each of the SSPs but outcomes differ widely across them, with urbanization reaching 60%, 79%, and 92% by the end of century in SSP3, SSP2, and SSP1/SSP4/SSP5, respectively. The degree of convergence in urbanization across countries also differs substantially, with largely convergent outcomes by the end of the century in SSP1 and SSP5 and persistent diversity in SSP3. This set of global, country-specific projections produces urbanization pathways that are typical of regions in different stages of urbanization and development levels, and can be extended to further elaborate assumptions about the styles of urban growth and spatial distributions of urban people and land cover occurring in each SSP.","","2016-06-03 07:13:29","2016-06-03 07:13:29","2016-06-03 07:13:29","","","","","","Global Environmental Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Urbanization projections; Long term; Socioeconomic scenarios; uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such re-aggregations are typically made using expert judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We describe a new, entropy-based approach to the plausible estimates of the spatial distribution of crop areas. Using this approach tabular crop production statistics are blended judiciously with an array of other secondary data to assess the areas of specific crops within individual ‘pixels’—typically 25–100 km2 in size. The information utilized includes crop production statistics, farming system characterization, satellite-based interpretation of land cover, biophysical crop suitability assessments, and population density. An application is presented in which Brazilian state level production statistics are used to generate pixel level crop area data for eight crops. To validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of municipality level areas in Brazil, and compared those estimates with actual municipality statistics. The approach produced extremely promising results. We then examined the robustness of these results compared to simplified approaches to spatializing crop production statistics and showed that, while computationally intensive, the cross-entropy method does provide more reliable spatial allocations.","2005-12","2016-06-07 13:27:03","2016-06-07 13:27:03","2016-06-07 13:27:03","310-323","","4","7","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","Bridging Scales and EpistemologiesLinking Local Knowledge with Global Science in Multi-Scale Assessments","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3PXCTDCN/You and Wood - 2005 - Assessing the spatial distribution of crop areas u.pdf","","","Production; entropy; Remote sensing; Cross-entropy; Spatial allocation; Crop suitability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It presents the projections and the main messages. The projections cover supply and demand for the major agricultural commodities and sectors, including fisheries and forestry. This analysis forms the basis for a more detailed examination of other factors, such as nutrition and undernourishment, and the implications for international trade. The report also investigates the implications of future supply and demand for the natural resource base and discusses how technology can contribute to more sustainable development. One of the report's main findings is that, if no corrective action is taken, the target set by the World Food Summit in 1996 (that of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015) is not going to be met. Nothing short of a massive effort at improving the overall development performance will free the developing world of its most pressing food insecurity problems. The progress made towards this target depends on many factors, not least of which are political will and the mobilization of additional resources. Past experience underlines the crucial role of agriculture in the development process, particularly where the majority of the population still depends on this sector for employment and income.","","2016-07-04 12:10:18","2016-07-04 12:10:18","2016-07-04 12:10:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","books.google.be","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animal and human health are increasingly interlinked through emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance. In many developing countries, the rapidity of change has also had social impacts with increased risk of marginalisation of smallholder farmers. However, both the impacts and benefits of livestock farming often differ between extensive (backyard farming mostly for home-consumption) and intensive, commercial production systems (larger herd or flock size, higher investments in inputs, a tendency towards market-orientation). A density of 10,000 chickens per km 2  has different environmental, epidemiological and societal implications if these birds are raised by 1,000 individual households or in a single industrial unit. Here, we introduce a novel relationship that links the national proportion of extensively raised animals to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in purchasing power parity).

Several ecological processes can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, we briefly describe approaches to spatial epidemiology that are spatially implicit, such as metapopulation models of disease transmission, and then focus on research in spatial epidemiology that is spatially explicit, such as the creation of risk maps for particular geographical areas. Although the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases are the subject of intensive study, the impacts of landscape structure on epidemiological processes have so far been neglected.

This is particularly relevant to Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic disease causing destructive outbreaks in livestock and man, as the geographical range of the disease is widening to involve previously unaffected regions. In the current study we investigate the application of methods developed in the decision sciences: multiple criteria decision making using weighted linear combination and ordered weighted averages, and Dempster-Shafer theory, implemented within the geographical information system IDRISI, to obtain a greater understanding of uncertainty related to the geographical distribution of RVF. The focus is on presenting alternate methods where extensive field data are not available and traditional, model-based approaches to disease mapping are impossible to conduct. Results Using a compensatory multiple criteria decision making model based on weighted linear combination, most of sub-Saharan Africa was suitable for endemic circulation of RVF. In contrast, areas where rivers and lakes traversed semi-arid regions, such as those bordering the Sahara, were highly suitable for RVF epidemics and wet, tropical areas of central Africa had low suitability. Using a moderately non-compensatory model based on ordered weighted averages, the areas considered suitable for endemic and epidemic RVF were more restricted. Varying the relative weights of the different factors in the models did not affect suitability estimates to a large degree, but variations in model structure had a large impact on our suitability estimates. Our Dempster-Shafer analysis supported the belief that a range of semi-arid areas were suitable for RVF epidemics and the plausibility that many other areas of the continent were suitable. Areas where high levels of uncertainty were highlighted included the Ethiopian Highlands, southwest Kenya and parts of West Africa. Conclusion We have demonstrated the potential of methods developed in the decision sciences to improve our understanding of uncertainties surrounding the geographical distribution of animal diseases, particularly where information is sparse, and encourage wider application of the decision science methodology in the field of animal health.","2006-12-10","2016-09-02 08:58:17","2016-09-02 08:58:17","2016-09-02 08:58:17","57","","","5","","Int J Health Geogr","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 17156467 PMCID: PMC1702539","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/5TF82ADI/Clements et al. - 2006 - Application of knowledge-driven spatial modelling .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1702539/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the outbreak progressed, global and local public health authorities scrambled to contain the spread of the disease by isolating those who were ill, putting in place infection control processes in health care settings, and encouraging the public to take steps to prevent the spread of the illness in the community. It took a massive investment of resources and personnel from many countries to eventually bring the outbreak under control. To determine where to allocate people and resources during the outbreak, public health authorities often turned to mathematical models created by scientists to predict the course of the outbreak and identify interventions that could be effective. Many groups of scientists created models of the epidemic using publically available data or data they obtained from government officials or field studies. In some instances, the models yielded valuable insights. But with various groups using different methods and data, the models didn’t always agree on what would happen next or how best to contain the epidemic. Now, Chretien et al. provide an overview of Ebola mathematical modeling during the epidemic and suggest how future efforts may be improved. The overview included 66 published studies about Ebola outbreak models. Although most forecasts predicted many more cases than actually occurred, some modeling approaches produced more accurate predictions, and several models yielded valuable insights. For example, one study found that focusing efforts on isolating patients with the most severe cases of Ebola would help end the epidemic by substantially reducing the number of new infections. Another study used real-time airline data to predict which traveler screening strategies would be most efficient at preventing international spread of Ebola. Furthermore, studies that obtained genomic data showed how specific virus strains were transmitted across geographic areas. Chretien et al. argue that mathematical modeling efforts could be more useful in future pubic health emergencies if modelers cooperated more, and suggest the collaborative approach of weather forecasters as a good example to follow. Greater data sharing and the creation of standards for epidemic modeling would aid better collaboration.","2015-12-08","2016-09-07 07:34:50","2016-09-07 07:34:50","2016-09-07 07:34:50","e09186","","","4","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015, Chretien et al.

However, in Thailand, which experienced two of the largest recorded epidemics in 2004-2005, the disease has been successfully reduced to very low levels. We fitted a spatio-temporal model of the spread of infection to outbreak data collected during the second wave of outbreaks to assess the extent to which different poultry types were responsible for propagating infection. Our estimates suggest that the wave of outbreaks would not have been possible without the contribution of backyard flocks to the susceptibility of a sub-district. However, we also estimated that outbreaks involving commercial poultry, a much larger sector in Thailand than in neighbouring countries, were disproportionately infectious, a factor which was also crucial in sustaining the wave. As a result, implemented measures that aim to reduce the role of commercial farms in the spread of infection, such as the drive to bring aspects of the supply chain 'in house', may help to explain the subsequent success in controlling H5N1 in Thailand. We also found that periods of active surveillance substantially improved the rate of outbreak detection.","2012-08-07","2016-09-07 07:43:13","2016-09-07 07:43:13","","1836-1845","","73","9","","J R Soc Interface","Outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Thailand","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22356818 PMCID: PMC3385766","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22356818","","Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Models, Biological; Poultry; Thailand; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we highlight the role that domestic poultry may play in maintaining A/H5N1 globally, using theoretical models of spatial population structure in poultry populations. We find that a metapopulation of moderately sized poultry flocks can sustain the pathogen in a finite poultry population for over two years. Our results suggest that it is possible that moderately intensive backyard farms could sustain the pathogen indefinitely in real systems.

Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.","2005-09-08","2016-09-07 07:45:14","2016-09-07 07:45:14","","209-214","","7056","437","","Nature","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16079797","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079797","","Asia, Southeastern; Communicable Disease Control; Computer Simulation; Contact Tracing; Humans; Influenza, Human; Models, Biological; Population Density; Reassortant Viruses; Thailand; Time Factors; Virus Replication; influenza A virus; Sensitivity and Specificity; Antiviral Agents; Mutation; Virus Shedding; Travel; Age Distribution; Quarantine; Probability; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent future outbreaks on this scale, it is imperative to understand the reasons that led to eventual disease control. Here, we evaluated the shifts of Ebola dynamics at national and local scales during the epidemic in Liberia. We used a transmission model calibrated to epidemiological data between June 9 and December 31, 2014, to estimate the extent of community and hospital transmission. We found that despite varied local epidemic patterns, community transmission was reduced by 40-80% in all the counties analyzed. Our model suggests that the tapering of the epidemic was achieved through reductions in community transmission, rather than accumulation of immune individuals through asymptomatic infection and unreported cases. Although the times at which this transmission reduction occurred in the majority of the Liberian counties started before any large expansion in hospital capacity and the distribution of home protection kits, it remains difficult to associate the presence of interventions with reductions in Ebola incidence.","2016-04","2016-09-07 07:46:15","2016-09-07 07:46:15","","833-839","","4","94","","Am.

Here we designed a dynamic transmission model to analyze the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea based on confirmed cases reported during the period May 20-July 4, 2015. Our model explicitly incorporates superspreading events and time-dependent transmission and isolation rates. Our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures, especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration. Early interventions within 1week after the epidemic onset, for instance, including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), show a promising means to reduce the size (>71%) and duration (>35%) of the MERS epidemic. Finally, we also present results of an uncertainty analysis focused on the role of superspreading events.","2016-08-10","2016-09-07 07:47:30","2016-09-07 07:47:30","","118-126","","","408","","J.

The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.","2010-01-19","2016-09-07 07:48:29","2016-09-07 07:48:29","","1041-1046","","3","107","","Proc.

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species’ distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species’ occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species’ distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.","2006-04-01","2016-09-07 08:13:16","2016-09-07 08:13:16","2016-09-07 08:13:16","129-151","","2","29","","Ecography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KH9GTPWB/Elith et al. - 2006 - Novel methods improve prediction of species’ distr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

Through a combined modelling approach, we estimate the rates of generation of cases along the zoonotic and human-to-human transmission routes and assess their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We consider all cases notified to WHO from March 2012 to mid-September 2014. We use a stochastic modelling of the time series of case incidence in the Middle East region to estimate time- and space-dependent zoonotic and human-to-human transmission parameters. The model also accounts for possible lack of identification of secondary transmissions among notified cases. This approach is combined with the analysis of imported cases out of the region to assess the rate of underreporting of cases. Out of a total of 32 possible models, based on different parameterisation and scenario considered, the best-fit model is characterised by a large heterogeneity in time and across space for both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. The variation in time that occurred during Spring 2014 led to a 17-fold and 3-fold increase in the two transmissions, respectively, bringing the reproductive rate to values above 1 during that period for all regions under study. The model suggests that 75% of MERS-CoV cases are secondary cases (human-to-human transmission), which is substantially higher than the 34% of reported cases with an epidemiological link to another case. Overall, estimated reporting rate is 0.26. Our findings show a higher level of spatial heterogeneity in zoonotic transmission compared to human-to-human, highlighting the strong environmental component of the epidemic. Since sporadic introductions are predicted to be a small proportion of notified cases and are responsible for triggering secondary transmissions, a more comprehensive understanding of zoonotic source and path of transmission could be critical to limit the epidemic spread.","2016-06","2016-09-08 08:50:26","2016-09-08 08:50:26","","1-9","","","15","","Epidemics","Quantifying spatiotemporal heterogeneity of MERS-CoV transmission in the Middle East region","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27266844","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266844","","Middle East respiratory syndrome; Multi-mode transmission; Outbreak analysis; Spatiotemporal heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that spatial distributions of HPAI-H5N1 cases are related consistently and predictably to coarse-scale environmental features in the Middle East and northeastern Africa.We used ecological niche models to relate virus occurrences to 8 km resolution digital data layers summarizing parameters of monthly surface reflectance and landform. Predictive challenges included a variety of spatial stratification schemes in which models were challenged to predict case distributions in broadly unsampled areas. RESULTS: In almost all tests, HPAI-H5N1 cases were indeed occurring under predictable sets of environmental conditions, generally predicted absent from areas with low NDVI values and minimal seasonal variation, and present in areas with a broad range of and appreciable seasonal variation in NDVI values. Although we documented significant predictive ability of our models, even between our study region and West Africa, case occurrences in the Arabian Peninsula appear to follow a distinct environmental regime.

However, when data arise from imperfect surveillance systems, the interpretation of results is confusing since explanatory variables can be related either to the occurrence of the disease or to the efficiency of the surveillance system. As an alternative, we present spatial and non-spatial zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regressions for modelling the number of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks that were reported at subdistrict level in Thailand during the second epidemic wave (July 3rd 2004 to May 5th 2005). The spatial ZIP model fitted the data more effectively than its non-spatial version. This model clarified the role of the different variables: for example, results suggested that human population density was not associated with the disease occurrence but was rather associated with the number of reported outbreaks given disease occurrence. In addition, these models allowed estimating that 902 (95% CI 881-922) subdistricts suffered at least one HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Thailand although only 779 were reported to veterinary authorities, leading to a general surveillance sensitivity of 86.4% (95% CI 84.5-88.4). Finally, the outputs of the spatial ZIP model revealed the spatial distribution of the probability that a subdistrict could have been a false negative. The methodology presented here can easily be adapted to other animal health contexts.","2014-04-01","2016-09-08 09:22:07","2016-09-08 09:22:07","","28-36","","1","114","","Prev. Vet.

To date, there has been considerable collection of data, but limited publically available analysis. This study utilizes data collected by the PDSR program between April 2008 and September 2010 for Java, Bali and the Lampung Province of Sumatra. The analysis employs hierarchical Bayesian occurrence models to quantify spatial and temporal dynamics in backyard HPAI infection reports at the District level in 90 day time periods, and relates the probability of HPAI occurrence to PDSR-reported village HPAI infection status and human and poultry density. The probability of infection in a District was assumed to be dependent on the status of the District in the previous 90 day time period, and described by either a colonization probability (the probability of HPAI infection in a District given there had not been infection in the previous 90 day time period) or a persistence probability (the probability of HPAI infection being maintained in the District from the previous to current 90 day period). Results suggest that the number of surveillance activities in a district had little relationship to outbreak occurrence probabilities, but human and poultry densities were found to have non-linear relationships to outbreak occurrence probabilities. We found significant spatial dependency among neighboring districts, indicating that there are latent spatial processes that are not captured by the covariates available for this study, but which nonetheless impact outbreak dynamics. The results of this work may help improve understanding of the seasonal nature of H5N1 in poultry and the potential role of poultry density in enabling endemicity to occur, as well as to assist the Government of Indonesia target scarce resources to regions and time periods when outbreaks of HPAI in poultry are most likely to occur.","2011-12-01","2016-09-08 09:43:17","2016-09-08 09:43:17","","206-217","","3","102","","Prev.

Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the ""second wave"" of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.","2010-06","2016-09-08 09:44:27","2016-09-08 09:44:27","","28","","3","41","","Vet.

Outbreaks are episodic and related to climate variability, especially rainfall and flooding. Despite great strides towards better prediction of RVF epidemics, there is still no observed climate data-based warning system with sufficient lead time for appropriate response and mitigation. We present a dynamic risk model based on historical RVF outbreaks and observed meteorological data. The model uses 30-year data on rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, normalised difference vegetation index and sea surface temperature data as predictors. Our research on RVF focused on Garissa, Murang'a and Kwale counties in Kenya using a research design based on a correlational, experimental, and evaluational approach. The weather data were obtained from the Kenya Meteorological Department while the RVF data were acquired from International Livestock Research Institute, and the Department of Veterinary Services. Performance of the model was evaluated by using the first 70% of the data for calibration and the remaining 30% for validation. The assessed components of the model accurately predicted already observed RVF events. The Brier score for each of the models (ranging from 0.007 to 0.022) indicated high skill. The coefficient of determination (R2) was higher in Garissa (0.66) than in Murang'a (0.21) and Kwale (0.16). The discrepancy was attributed to data distribution differences and varying ecosystems. The model outputs should complement existing early warning systems to detect risk factors that predispose for RVF outbreaks.","2016","2016-09-09 08:06:42","2016-09-09 08:06:42","","377","","2","11","","Geospat Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27245792","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245792","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using surveillance records collected between 1951 and 2007, we determined the risk of exposure and outcome of an RVF outbreak, examined the ecological and climatic factors associated with the outbreaks, and used these data to develop an RVF risk map for Kenya. METHODS: Exposure to RVF was evaluated as the proportion of the total outbreak years that each district was involved in prior epizootics, whereas risk of outcome was assessed as severity of observed disease in humans and animals for each district. A probability-impact weighted score (1 to 9) of the combined exposure and outcome risks was used to classify a district as high (score ≥ 5) or medium (score ≥2 - <5) risk, a classification that was subsequently subjected to expert group analysis for final risk level determination at the division levels (total = 391 divisions). Divisions that never reported RVF disease (score < 2) were classified as low risk. Using data from the 2006/07 RVF outbreak, the predictive risk factors for an RVF outbreak were identified. The predictive probabilities from the model were further used to develop an RVF risk map for Kenya. RESULTS: The final output was a RVF risk map that classified 101 of 391 divisions (26%) located in 21 districts as high risk, and 100 of 391 divisions (26%) located in 35 districts as medium risk and 190 divisions (48%) as low risk, including all 97 divisions in Nyanza and Western provinces. The risk of RVF was positively associated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), low altitude below 1000m and high precipitation in areas with solonertz, luvisols and vertisols soil types (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: RVF risk map serves as an important tool for developing and deploying prevention and control measures against the disease.","2016","2016-09-09 09:45:14","2016-09-09 09:45:14","","e0144570","","1","11","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26808021 PMCID: PMC4726791","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808021","","Aedes; Altitude; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Disease Outbreaks; Ecology; Female; Humans; Insect Vectors; Male; Population Surveillance; Rift Valley Fever; Risk Factors; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Kenya; Goat Diseases; Goats; Rain; Soil; Camels; Buffaloes; Abortion, Veterinary; Pregnancy; geographic mapping; animals; climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlation and regression analyses of long time series rainfall, vegetation index, and temperature data show that large scale anomalies occur periodically that may influence mosquito vector populations and thus spatial and temporal patterns of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya outbreaks. Rift Valley fever outbreak events occurred after a period of ∼3–4 months of persistent and above-normal rainfall that enabled vector habitats to flourish. On the other hand, chikungunya outbreaks occurred during periods of high temperatures and severe drought over East Africa and the western Indian Ocean islands. This is consistent with highly populated environmental settings where domestic and peri-domestic stored water containers were the likely mosquito sources. However, in Southeast Asia, approximately 52% of chikungunya outbreaks occurred during cooler-than-normal temperatures and were significantly negatively correlated with drought. Besides climate variability, other factors not accounted for such as vertebrate host immunity may contribute to spatio-temporal patterns of outbreaks.","2012-01-24","2016-09-09 09:53:42","2016-09-09 09:53:42","2016-09-09 09:53:42","e1465","","1","6","","PLOS Negl Trop Dis","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/NF33SQ3R/Anyamba et al. - 2012 - Climate Teleconnections and Recent Patterns of Hum.pdf","","","Africa; Rain; Rift Valley fever virus; Mosquitoes; Chikungunya infection; Drought; El Niño-Southern Oscillation; Veterinary diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5.Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change.

The genetic diversity (16 haemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes) of AIV indicates an extensive reservoir of influenza viruses exists in bird populations, but how frequently subtypes reassort with each other is still unknown. Here we quantify the reassortment patterns among subtypes in the Eurasian avian viral pool by reconstructing the ancestral states of the subtypes as discrete states on time-scaled phylogenies with respect to the internal protein coding segments. We further analyzed how host species, the inferred evolutionary rates and the dN/dS ratio varied among segments and between discrete subtypes, and whether these factors may be associated with inter-subtype reassortment rate.","2014","2016-09-28 15:04:34","2016-09-28 15:04:34","2016-09-28 15:04:34","16","","","14","","BMC Evolutionary Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioMed Central","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZI6F5MF7/Lu et al. - 2014 - Reassortment patterns of avian influenza virus int.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, quail has become a popular terrestrial poultry species raised for production of meat and eggs in Asia. In this study, to better understand the roles of quail in H5N1 viral evolution, two H5N1-positive samples, designated A/quail/Vietnam/CVVI-49/2010 (CVVI-49/2010) and A/quail/Vietnam/CVVI-50/2014 (CVVI-50/2014), were isolated from quail during H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam, and their whole genome were analyzed. The phylogenetic analysis reveals new evolutionary variation in the worldwide H5N1 viruses. The quail HA genes were clustered into clades 1.1.1 (CVVI-49/2010) and clade 2.3.2.1c (CVVI-50/2014), which may have evolved from viruses circulating from chickens and/or ducks in Cambodia, mainland of China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea in recent years. Interestingly, the M2 gene of the CVVI-49/2010 strain contained amino acid substitutions at position 26 L-I  and 31 S-N  that are related to amantadine-resistance. In particular, the CVVI-50/2014 strain revealed evidence of multiple intersubtype reassortment events between virus clades 2.3.2.1c, 2.3.2.1b, and 2.3.2.1a. Data from this study supports the possible role of quail as an important intermediate host in avian influenza virus evolution. Therefore, additional surveillance is needed to monitor these HPAI viruses both serologically and virologically in quail.","2016-02-22","2016-09-15 12:02:27","2016-09-15 12:02:27","2016-09-15 12:02:27","e0149608","","2","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7T8UXEXK/Nguyen et al. - 2016 - Intersubtype Reassortments of H5N1 Highly Pathogen.pdf","","","viral evolution; H5N1; Phylogenetic analysis; Poultry; Vietnam; Evolutionary genetics; Quails; Sequence databases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, in deriving populations at risk of disease estimates, these spatial models must rely on existing global and regional datasets on population distribution, which are often based on outdated and coarse resolution data. Moreover, a variety of different methods have been used to model population distribution at large spatial scales. In this review we describe the main global gridded population datasets that are freely available for health researchers and compare their construction methods, and highlight the uncertainties inherent in these population datasets. We review their application in past studies on disease risk and dynamics, and discuss how the choice of dataset can affect results. Moreover, we highlight how the lack of contemporary, detailed and reliable data on human population distribution in low income countries is proving a barrier to obtaining accurate large-scale estimates of population at risk and constructing reliable models of disease spread, and suggest research directions required to further reduce these barriers.","2012-03-20","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","2016-09-30 09:14:47","7","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","En","2012 Linard and Tatem; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/RNENZPZT/Linard and Tatem - 2012 - Large-scale spatial population databases in infect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the ""pathogenecity"" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.","2010-10-27","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","2016-09-30 09:19:35","54","","1","9","","","Pathogenic landscapes","","","","","","","En","2010 Lambin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/DQ83XWI5/Lambin et al. - 2010 - Pathogenic landscapes Interactions between land, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sanmenxia Clade 2.3.2.1c-like H5N1 viruses possess the closest genetic identity to A/Alberta/01/2014 (H5N1), which recently caused a fatal respiratory infection in Canada with signs of meningoencephalitis, a highly unusual symptom with influenza infections in humans. Furthermore, this virus was shown to be highly pathogenic to both birds and mammals, and demonstrate tropism for the nervous system. Due to the geographical location of Sanmenxia, these novel H5N1 viruses also have the potential to be imported to other regions through the migration of wild birds, similar to the H5N1 outbreak amongst migratory birds in Qinghai Lake during 2005.

In this report, we analyzed 51 representative H5N1 AIVs isolated from domestic poultry, wild birds, and humans in China during 2004 to 2009, and 21 genotypes were detected based on whole-genome sequences. Twelve genotypes of AIVs in southern China bear similar H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (clade 2.3). These AIVs did not display antigenic drift and could be completely protected against by the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (GS/GD/1/96)-based oil-adjuvanted killed vaccine and recombinant Newcastle disease virus vaccine, which have been used in China. In addition, antigenically drifted H5N1 viruses, represented by A/chicken/Shanxi/2/06 (CK/SX/2/06), were detected in chickens from several provinces in northern China. The CK/SX/2/06-like viruses are reassortants with newly emerged HA, NA, and PB1 genes that could not be protected against by the GS/GD/1/96-based vaccines. These viruses also reacted poorly with antisera generated from clade 2.2 and 2.3 viruses. The majority of the viruses isolated from southern China were lethal in mice and ducks, while the CK/SX/2/06-like viruses caused mild disease in mice and could not replicate in ducks.

Between the end of February and the end of May 2003, a fowl plague outbreak occurred in The Netherlands. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H7N7, closely related to low pathogenic virus isolates obtained from wild ducks, was isolated from chickens. The same virus was detected subsequently in 86 humans who handled affected poultry and in three of their family members. Of these 89 patients, 78 presented with conjunctivitis, 5 presented with conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness, 2 presented with influenza-like illness, and 4 did not fit the case definitions. Influenza-like illnesses were generally mild, but a fatal case of pneumonia in combination with acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred also. Most virus isolates obtained from humans, including probable secondary cases, had not accumulated significant mutations. However, the virus isolated from the fatal case displayed 14 amino acid substitutions, some of which may be associated with enhanced disease in this case. Because H7N7 viruses have caused disease in mammals, including horses, seals, and humans, on several occasions in the past, they may be unusual in their zoonotic potential and, thus, form a pandemic threat to humans.","2004-02-03","2016-10-10 12:39:44","2016-10-10 12:39:44","2016-10-10 12:39:44","1356-1361","","5","101","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 14745020","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/UF7GNZSB/Fouchier et al. - 2004 - Avian influenza A virus (H7N7) associated with hum.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the first detected human case among all human cases identified from 2014 to early 2016. We obtained and summarized clinical, epidemiological, and virological data from this patient. Complete genome of the virus was determined and compared to other avian influenza viruses via the construction of phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining approach. A girl aged five and half years developed fever and mild respiratory symptoms on Feb. 16, 2014 and visited hospital on Feb. 17. Throat swab specimens were obtained from the patient and a novel reassortant avian influenza A H5N6 virus was detected. All eight viral gene segments were of avian origin. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments were closely related to A/duck/Sichuan/NCXN11/2014(H5N1) and A/chicken/Jiangxi/12782/2014(H10N6) viruses, respectively. The six internal genes were homologous to avian influenza A (H5N2) viruses isolated in duck from Jiangxi in China. This H5N6 virus has not gained genetic mutations necessary for human infection and was suggested to be sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, but resistant to adamantanes. Epidemiological investigation of the exposure history of the patient found that a live poultry market could be the source place of infection and the incubation period was 2–5 days. This novel reassortant Avian influenza A(H5N6) virus could be low pathogenic in humans. The prevalence and genetic evolution of this virus should be closely monitored.","2016-06","2016-11-08 03:40:35","2016-11-08 03:40:35","2016-11-08 03:40:35","236-242","","","40","","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KT3HMHGX/Zhang et al. - 2016 - Clinical, epidemiological and virological characte.pdf","","","Reassortant; H5N6; Sequence; The first detected human case; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that even such successful advances are insufficient for many emergent diseases. We review work hypothesizing that Makona, phenotypically similar to much smaller outbreaks, emerged out of shifts in land use brought about by neoliberal economics. The epidemiological consequences demand a new science that explicitly addresses the foundational processes underlying multispecies health, including the deep-time histories, cultural infrastructure, and global economic geographies driving disease emergence. The approach, for instance, reverses the standard public health practice of segregating emergency responses and the structural context from which outbreaks originate. In Ebola's case, regional neoliberalism may affix the stochastic ""friction"" of ecological relationships imposed by the forest across populations, which, when above a threshold, keeps the virus from lining up transmission above replacement. Export-led logging, mining, and intensive agriculture may depress such functional noise, permitting novel spillovers larger forces of infection. Mature outbreaks, meanwhile, can continue to circulate even in the face of efficient vaccines. More research on these integral explanations is required, but the narrow albeit welcome success of the vaccine may be used to limit support of such a program.","2016","2016-11-09 20:27:03","2016-11-09 20:27:03","","149-165","","1","46","","Int J Health Serv","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26581892","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581892","","Conservation of Natural Resources; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Forests; Africa, Western; ebola; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Cultural Characteristics; Ebola Vaccines; Politics; Structural One Health; ecological stochasticity; neoliberalism; vaccine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2006, an atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand. This study aimed to provide a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors. This should provide a basis for improving disease surveillance and control of PRRS in Thailand. RESULTS: Spatial scan statistics were used to detect clusters of outbreaks and allowed the identification of six spatial clusters covering 15 provinces of Thailand. Two modeling approaches were used to relate the presence or absence of PRRS outbreaks at the sub-district level to demographic characteristics of pig farming and other epidemiological spatial variables: autologistic multiple regressions and boosted regression trees (BRT). The variables showing a statistically significant association with PRRS presence in the autologistic multiple regression model were the sub-district human population and number of farms with breeding sows. The predictive power of the model, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots was moderate. BRT models had higher goodness of fit the metrics and identified the sub-district human population and density of farms with breeding sows as important predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country.","2014-08-05","2016-11-10 13:41:48","2016-11-10 13:41:48","","174","","","10","","BMC Vet.

The introduction of Eurasian lineage HP H5 clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 IAV and subsequent reassortment with low-pathogenic H?N2 and H?N1 North American wild bird-origin IAVs in late 2014 resulted in widespread HP H5Nx IAV infections and outbreaks in poultry and wild birds across two-thirds of North America starting in November 2014 and continuing through June 2015. Although the stamping out strategies adopted by the poultry industry and animal health authorities in Canada and the United States—which included culling, quarantining, increased biosecurity, and abstention from vaccine use—were successful in eradicating the HP H5Nx viruses from poultry, these activities do not explain the apparent disappearance of these viruses from migratory waterfowl. Here we examine current and historical aquatic bird IAV surveillance and outbreaks of HP H5Nx in poultry in the United States and Canada, providing additional evidence of unresolved mechanisms that restrict the emergence and perpetuation of HP avian influenza viruses in these natural reservoirs.","2016-08-09","2016-11-10 14:36:31","2016-11-10 14:36:31","2016-11-10 14:36:31","9033-9038","","32","113","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","PMID: 27457948","","; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HH34MP3S/9033.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457948","","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza; surveillance; Wild bird; migratory waterfowl; restricted perpetuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before that, it was unknown or unclear if the disease or the pathogen affected people. This study illustrates the virological and clinical findings of a fatal H5N6 virus infection in a human patient. METHODS: We obtained and analyzed the clinical, epidemiological, and virological data from the patient. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing were conducted for determination of the causative pathogen. RESULTS: The patient, who presented with fever, severe pneumonia, leucopenia, and lymphopenia, developed septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and died on day 10 after illness onset. A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H5N6) virus was isolated from the throat swab or trachea aspirate of the patient. The virus was reassorted with the HA gene of clade 2.3.4.4 H5, the internal genes of clade 2.3.2.1 H5, and the NA gene of the H6N6 avian virus. The cleavage site of the HA gene contained multiple basic amino acids, indicating that the novel H5N6 virus was highly pathogenic in chicken. CONCLUSIONS: A novel, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 virus with a backbone of H5N1 virus acquired from the NA gene from the H6N6 virus has been identified. It caused human infection resulting in severe respiratory disease.","2016-01","2016-11-23 03:55:11","2016-11-23 03:55:11","","52-59","","1","72","","J.

Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these H5N6 viruses were novel reassortants between H5N1 clade 2.3.4 and H6N6 viruses, and had evolved into two distinct lineages (Sichuan and Jiangxi). Moreover, the human H5N6 virus was closely related to the avian-source viruses of Sichuan lineage. Notably, H5N6 viruses contained a T160A substitution in the haemagglutinin protein and an 11 aa deletion in the neuraminidase stalk, which may aid in enhancing viral affinity for human-like receptors and virulence in mammals. As the H5N1 virus infects humans through direct contact, infection with the novel H5N6 virus raised significant concerns that the H5 subtype was a likely candidate for a pandemic. Therefore, extensive and long-term surveillance of avian influenza viruses in LPMs is essential.","2015-05","2016-11-23 04:16:11","2016-11-23 04:16:11","","975-981","","Pt 5","96","","J. Gen.

Although human infections with H5N1 have to date been limited, concerns for the pandemic potential of this zoonotic virus have been greatly intensified following experimental evidence of aerosol transmission of H5N1 viruses in a mammalian infection model. In this review, we discuss the dominance of the haemagglutinin cleavage site motif as a pathogenicity determinant, the host‐pathogen molecular interactions driving cleavage activation, reverse genetics manipulations and identification of residues key to haemagglutinin cleavage site functionality and the mechanisms of cell and tissue damage during H5N1 infection. We specifically focus on the disease in chickens, as it is in this species that high pathogenicity frequently evolves and from which transmission to the human population occurs. With >75% of emerging infectious diseases being of zoonotic origin, it is necessary to understand pathogenesis in the primary host to explain spillover events into the human population. © 2015 The Authors.

This slow spread, as well as the lack of gross lesions, clinical signs, or high mortality, hindered the field veterinarian from reporting a suspected HPAI outbreak to the veterinary office. To understand the field conditions for the slow virus spread, we examined contact and airborne transmission of the H5N1 virus to chickens in a negative-pressure isolator using various numbers of infected chickens and separate compartments. We found that the contact transmission did occur inefficiently when one or two chickens were infected, whereas the transmission was efficient when four chickens were infected. Airborne transmission of the HPAI virus was also dependent on the number of infected chickens and was less efficient than contact transmission. These data together with field observations suggested that number of infected chickens, chicken house types, and amount of environmental contamination might affect the virus transmission efficiency to chickens.","2007-03-01","2016-12-05 04:29:11","2016-12-05 04:29:11","2016-12-05 04:29:11","129-132","","1","51","","Avian Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","bioone.org (Atypon)","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/M67ZDQFW/0005-2086(2007)051[0129IODHCO]2.0.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The genetic diversity (16 haemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes) of AIV indicates an extensive reservoir of influenza viruses exists in bird populations, but how frequently subtypes reassort with each other is still unknown. Here we quantify the reassortment patterns among subtypes in the Eurasian avian viral pool by reconstructing the ancestral states of the subtypes as discrete states on time-scaled phylogenies with respect to the internal protein coding segments. We further analyzed how host species, the inferred evolutionary rates and the dN/dS ratio varied among segments and between discrete subtypes, and whether these factors may be associated with inter-subtype reassortment rate. Results The general patterns of reassortment are similar among five internal segments with the exception of segment 8, encoding the Non-Structural genes, which has a more divergent phylogeny. However, significant variation in rates between subtypes was observed. In particular, hemagglutinin-encoding segments of subtypes H5 to H9 reassort at a lower rate compared to those of H1 to H4, and Neuraminidase-encoding segments of subtypes N1 and N2 reassort less frequently than N3 to N9. Both host species and dN/dS ratio were significantly associated with reassortment rate, while evolutionary rate was not associated. The dN/dS ratio was negatively correlated with reassortment rate, as was the number of negatively selected sites for all segments. Conclusions These results indicate that overall selective constraint and host species are both associated with reassortment rate. These results together identify the wild bird population as the major source of new reassortants, rather than domestic poultry. The lower reassortment rates observed for H5N1 and H9N2 may be explained by the large proportion of strains derived from domestic poultry populations. In contrast, the higher rates observed in the H1N1, H3N8 and H4N6 subtypes could be due to their primary origin as infections of wild birds with multiple low pathogenicity strains in the large avian reservoir.","2014-01-24","2016-12-05 06:03:24","2016-12-05 06:03:24","2016-12-05 06:03:24","16","","","14","","BMC Evol Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24456010 PMCID: PMC3905155","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BD6NHRZM/Lu et al. - 2014 - Reassortment patterns of avian influenza virus int.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide new insights into the evolutionary dynamics and the adaptive strategies of distinct avian influenza lineages in response to environmental and host factors, we compared two distinct avian influenza epidemics caused by the H7N1 and H7N3 subtypes that circulated under similar epidemiological conditions, including the same domestic species reared in the same densely populated poultry area for similar periods of time. The two strains appear to have experienced largely divergent evolution: the H7N1 viruses evolved into a highly pathogenic form, while the H7N3 did not. However, a more detailed molecular and evolutionary analysis revealed several common features: (i) the independent acquisition of 32 identical mutations throughout the entire genome; (ii) the evolution and persistence of two sole genetic groups with similar genetic characteristics; (iii) a comparable pattern of amino acid variability of the HA proteins during the low pathogenic epidemics; and (iv) similar rates of nucleotide substitutions. These findings suggest that the evolutionary trajectories of viruses with the same virulence level circulating in analogous epidemiological conditions may be similar. In addition, our deep sequencing analysis of 15 samples revealed that 17 of the 32 parallel mutations were already present at the beginning of the two epidemics, suggesting that fixation of these mutations may occur with different mechanisms, which may depend on the fitness gain provided by each mutation. This highlighted the difficulties in predicting the acquisition of mutations that can be correlated to viral adaptation to specific epidemiological conditions or to changes in virus virulence.","2015-08","2016-12-06 08:11:31","2016-12-06 08:11:31","2016-12-06 08:11:31","457-466","","","34","","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","Evolutionary trajectories of two distinct avian influenza epidemics","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/S2JX97NW/S1567134815001823.html","","","Avian influenza virus; Deep sequencing; Evolutionary dynamics; H7 subtype; Molecular analysis; Parallel evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infection of chicken with the quail- and turkey-adapted viruses showed an increased pathogenicity and/or shedding, causing more severe clinical signs and/or higher levels of viral excretion compared to the original strain.

Compared to the wild type, the MZ-delNA virus showed a moderate growth advantage on avian cultured cells. In 4-week-old chickens inoculated intratracheally with the MZ-delNA virus, viral replication in the lungs, liver, and kidneys was enhanced and interstitial pneumonia lesions were more severe than with the wild-type virus.

Molecular mechanisms possibly underlying the growth advantage of the MZ-delNA virus were explored. The measured enzymatic activities toward a small substrate were similar for the wild-type and deleted NA, but the MZ-delNA virus eluted from chicken erythrocytes at reduced rates. Pseudoviral particles expressing the MZ hemagglutinin in combination with the MZ-NA or MZ-delNA protein were produced from avian cultured cells with similar efficiencies, suggesting that the deletion in the NA stalk does not enhance the release of progeny virions and probably affects an earlier step of the viral cycle.

Intuition suggests that parasites should evolve to be benign whenever the host is needed for transmission. Yet a growing theoretical literature offers several models to explain why natural selection may favor virulent parasites over avirulent ones. This perspective first organizes these models into a simple framework and then evaluates the empirical evidence for and against the models. There is relatively scant evidence to support any of the models rigorously, and indeed, there are only a few unequivocal observations of virulence actually evolving in parasite populations. These shortcomings are surmountable, however, and empirical models of host-parasite interactions have been developed for many kinds of pathogens so that the relevant data could be acquired in the near future. Aside from academic interest, the evolution of virulence has potential medical and agricultural ramifications that may provide evolutionary biology with opportunities for contributions to human welfare. For example, understanding the evolution of parasite virulence may help us design better vaccines, prevent the emergence of highly virulent strains in the future, and diminish the virulence of present pathogens. These potential applications notwithstanding, the usefulness of an evolutionary theory of virulence to social problems has not been demonstrated and is even doubtful in some cases. One promising area for contributions from evolutionary theory is in designing live, attenuated vaccines.","1994","2016-12-05 04:14:55","2016-12-05 04:14:55","2016-12-05 04:14:55","1423-1437","","5","48","","Evolution","Perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outbreaks of avian influenza due to an H7N1 virus of low pathogenicity occurred in domestic poultry in northern Italy from March 1999 until December 1999 when a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus emerged. Nucleotide sequences were determined for the HA1 and the stalk region of the neuraminidase (NA) for viruses from the outbreaks. The HPAI viruses have an unusual multibasic haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site motif, PEIPKG RGLF. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HPAI viruses arose from low pathogenicity viruses and that they are most closely related to a wild bird isolate, A/teal/ Taiwan/98. Additional glycosylation sites were present at amino acid position 149 of the HA for two separate lineages, and at position 123 for all HPAI and some low pathogenicity viruses. Other viruses had no additional glycosylation sites. All viruses examined from the Italian outbreaks had a 22 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk that is not present in the N1 genes of the wild bird viruses examined. We conclude that the Italian HPAI viruses arose from low pathogenicity strains, and that a deletion in the NA stalk followed by the acquisition of additional glycosylation near the receptor binding site of HA1 may be an adaptation of H7 viruses to a new host species i.e. domestic poultry.","2001-05-01","2016-12-06 08:52:05","2016-12-06 08:52:05","2016-12-06 08:52:05","963-973","","5","146","","Arch.

Similarly, studies indicate turkeys to be better hosts for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from commercial poultry operations and live bird markets in comparison to chickens. Low 50% infectious-dose titers of wild bird as well as poultry-adapted viruses for turkeys further suggest that turkeys can be easily infected following a low-dose exposure. Also, interspecies transmission of swine influenza viruses to turkeys occurs frequently. These findings suggest the role of turkeys as suitable intermediate hosts that can be easily infected with influenza viruses of different origins and that turkeys can act as source of infection for other land-based poultry or even mammals.","2010-03","2016-12-05 02:40:19","2016-12-05 02:40:19","","522-526","","1 Suppl","54","","Avian Dis.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 20521688","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521688","","Disease Susceptibility; Influenza in Birds; Turkeys; United States; influenza A virus; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although low pathogenic avian influenza viruses persist and evolve in wild populations, HPAI viruses evolve in domestic birds and cause economically serious epizootics that only occasionally infect wild populations. We propose that evolutionary ecology considerations can explain this apparent paradox. Host structure and transmission possibilities differ considerably between wild and domestic birds and are likely to be major determinants of virulence. Because viral fitness is highly dependent on host survival and dispersal in nature, virulent forms are unlikely to persist in wild populations if they kill hosts quickly or affect predation risk or migratory performance. Interhost transmission in water has evolved in low pathogenic influenza viruses in wild waterfowl populations. However, oropharyngeal shedding and transmission by aerosols appear more efficient for HPAI viruses among domestic birds.","2010-07","2016-12-05 05:01:15","2016-12-05 05:01:15","2016-12-05 05:01:15","1057-1062","","7","16","","Emerg Infect Dis","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20587174 PMCID: PMC3321889","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/S6FJ9JHP/Lebarbenchon et al. - 2010 - Persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza V.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321889/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This virus circulated in unvaccinated and vaccinated poultry farms, and the infection was controlled in August 2003 by culling, control of movements, improved biosecurity, and heterologous vaccination. In 2004, H7N3 reoccurred in vaccinated poultry farms in which infection had been successfully controlled by the vaccination program. To shed light on this occurrence and the temporal pattern and genetic basis of antigenic drift for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in the absence and presence of heterologous vaccination, a collection of H7N3 viruses isolated in 2002 and 2004 were characterized genetically and antigenically. Molecular analysis showed that viruses isolated in the 2004 outbreaks after the implementation of vaccination had acquired specific amino acid signatures, most of which were located at reported antibody binding sites of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Antigenic characterization of these 2004 isolates showed that they were antigenically different from those isolated prior to the implementation of vaccination. This is the first report on antigenic and genetic evolution of H7 LPAI viruses following the application of heterologous vaccination in poultry.

Although human infections with H5N1 have to date been limited, concerns for the pandemic potential of this zoonotic virus have been greatly intensified following experimental evidence of aerosol transmission of H5N1 viruses in a mammalian infection model. In this review, we discuss the dominance of the haemagglutinin cleavage site motif as a pathogenicity determinant, the host‐pathogen molecular interactions driving cleavage activation, reverse genetics manipulations and identification of residues key to haemagglutinin cleavage site functionality and the mechanisms of cell and tissue damage during H5N1 infection. We specifically focus on the disease in chickens, as it is in this species that high pathogenicity frequently evolves and from which transmission to the human population occurs. With >75% of emerging infectious diseases being of zoonotic origin, it is necessary to understand pathogenesis in the primary host to explain spillover events into the human population. © 2015 The Authors.

Eighteen of the 76 viruses were isolated in 1993 and 1994 from various sources in the United States. In addition, 34 H5 (4 highly pathogenic [HP] and 30 non-highly pathogenic [non-HP]) and 24 H7 (3 HP and 21 non-HP) repository viruses, isolated between 1927 and 1992, were sequenced and the sequences compared to those in recent isolates. All repository HP H5 and H7 viruses studied had multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the HA cleavage site and most had basic amino acids in excess of the proposed minimum motif B-X-B-R (B = basic amino acids arginine or lysine, X = nonbasic amino acid, R = arginine) that has been associated with high pathogenicity. Of the non-HP viruses studied,  35 of 38 for H5 and 30 of 31 for H7 conformed to the motif B-X-X-R and B-X-R, respectively. Two non-HP H5 viruses had the motif X-X-X-R at the cleavage site and a third had the motif B-X-X-K (K = basic amino acid lysine). One non-HP H7 (A/Pekin robin/CA/30412-5/94) had four basic amino acids (K-R-R-R) adjacent to the cleavage site. Although the Pekin robin isolate did not produce disease in chickens under the conditions of the study it did have the amino acid sequence compatible with that in HP AI viruses and, therefore, is considered potentially HP. This is the first account of an H7 virus that is non-HP in chickens but meets the molecular criterion to be classified as HP.","1996-06","2016-12-06 05:53:50","2016-12-06 05:53:50","","425-437","","2","40","","Avian Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 8790895","","","","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Birds; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Species Specificity; United States; Polymerase Chain Reaction; DNA Primers; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/*chemistry/genetics; Influenza A virus/*immunology/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity; Virulence/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses DOI: 10.1111/j.1750‐2659.2012.00354.x.,  Background  Avian influenza viruses (AIV) cause huge economic losses in poultry industries and pose a substantial threat to human health. However, predicting AIV epizootics and emergence in humans is confounded by insufficient empirical data on the ecology and dynamics of AIV in poultry systems. To address this gap, we quantified incidence patterns for 13 hemagglutinin subtypes of AIV using 6 years of surveillance data that were collected from ten different species of poultry and three different types of poultry holdings (contexts) – retail, wholesale, or farms.,  Methods  We collected 42 646 samples in Shantou, China between 2000 and 2006. We screened samples for hemagglutinin subtypes 1–13 of AIV and Avian Paramyxovirus‐type‐1 (APMV‐1) using monospecific antisera in hemagglutination inhibition tests. We analyzed the data to determine seasonality patterns, subtype–host, and subtype–subtype interactions as well as subtype bias in incidence in different contexts.,  Results  H3, H6, H9, and APMV‐1 were the most prevalent. No significant seasonality was found when all subtypes were considered together. For most AIV subtypes and APMV‐1, there was subtype specificity for host, context, and coinfection partner. H5 showed the most generalized host usage pattern, followed by H9 and H6.,  Conclusion  Subtype‐specific patterns because of host, context, and other subtypes suggest that risk assessments that exclude these details are likely inaccurate. Surveillance should include longitudinal sampling of multiple host species in multiple contexts. Quantitative models of control strategies must consider multiple subtypes, hosts, and source contexts to assess the effectiveness of interventions.","2013-01","2016-12-12 06:03:35","2016-12-12 06:03:35","2016-12-12 06:03:35","97-107","","1","7","","Influenza Other Respir Viruses","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22458429 PMCID: PMC4061500","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MPK83SF2/Pepin et al. - 2013 - Multiannual patterns of influenza A transmission i.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061500/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, since late 2002, H5N1 outbreaks in Asia have resulted in mortality among waterfowl in recreational parks, domestic flocks, and wild migratory birds. The evolutionary stasis between influenza virus and its natural host may have been disrupted, prompting us to ask whether waterfowl are resistant to H5N1 influenza virus disease and whether they can still act as a reservoir for these viruses. To better understand the biology of H5N1 viruses in ducks and attempt to answer this question, we inoculated juvenile mallards with 23 different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated in Asia between 2003 and 2004. All virus isolates replicated efficiently in inoculated ducks, and 22 were transmitted to susceptible contacts. Viruses replicated to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the main site of H5N1 influenza virus replication in ducks and that the fecal-oral route may no longer be the main transmission path. The virus isolates' pathogenicities varied from completely nonpathogenic to highly lethal and were positively correlated with tracheal virus titers. Nevertheless, the eight virus isolates that were nonpathogenic in ducks replicated and transmitted efficiently to naïve contacts, suggesting that highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses causing minimal signs of disease in ducks can propagate silently and efficiently among domestic and wild ducks in Asia and that they represent a serious threat to human and veterinary public health.","2005-09","2016-12-12 05:36:24","2016-12-12 05:36:24","2016-12-12 05:36:24","11269-11279","","17","79","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 16103179 PMCID: PMC1193583","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9GMKK6VC/Sturm-Ramirez et al. - 2005 - Are Ducks Contributing to the Endemicity of Highly.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1193583/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential for immunological cross-protection between these pathogenic variants is recognised but the epidemiological impact during co-circulation is not well understood. Here we use mathematical models to investigate whether altered flock infection parameters consequent to primary LPAI infections can impact on the spread of HPAI at the population level. First we used mechanistic models reflecting the co-circulatory dynamics of LPAI and HPAI within a single commercial poultry flock. We found that primary infections with LPAI led to HPAI prevalence being maximised under a scenario of high but partial cross-protection. We then tested the population impact in spatially-explicit simulations motivated by a major avian influenza A(H7N1) epidemic that afflicted the Italian poultry industry in 1999–2001. We found that partial cross-protection can lead to a prolongation of HPAI epidemic duration.

Although H5N1 viruses currently cannot transmit efficiently between mammals they exhibit high mortality in humans and recent experimental studies have shown that it is possible to generate an H5N1 virus that is transmissible in mammals.

The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution that is, in this instance, associated with geographic regions. On the basis of the analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, in conjunction with the occurrence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is nearly exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of reassortants arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.","2010-10","2016-12-09 03:35:13","2016-12-09 03:35:13","2016-12-09 03:35:13","9957-9966","","19","84","","J Virol","Molecular Analysis of H7 Avian Influenza Viruses from Australia and New Zealand","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20668069 PMCID: PMC2937813","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZWK82I8D/Bulach et al. - 2010 - Molecular Analysis of H7 Avian Influenza Viruses f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 2004 isolate replicated and spread most efficiently, and chickens previously inoculated with this H9N2 virus showed 90%–100% survival after inoculation 1 to 35 days later with lethal H5N1 virus.

Influenza A viruses are isolated from a variety of animal species with varying morbidity and mortality rates. More importantly, influenza A viruses cause respiratory disease in humans with potentially fatal outcome. Local or global outbreaks in humans are typically characterized by excess hospitalizations and deaths. In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype emerged in Hong Kong that transmitted to humans, resulting in the first documented cases of human death by avian influenza virus infection. A new outbreak started in July 2003 in poultry in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand, and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses have since spread throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa. These viruses continue to infect humans with a high mortality rate and cause worldwide concern of a looming pandemic. Moreover, H5N1 virus outbreaks have had devastating effects on the poultry industries throughout Asia.

To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on detection of influenza H5 viruses, and there is limited understanding of influenza H9 epidemiology and transmission dynamics. We determined prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) of 7 northern Vietnamese provinces, using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real time RT-PCR revealed 1207/4900 (24.6%) of pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5.8% (CI 5.4–6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct &lt; 26. No influenza H7 was detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence was of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 whole genomes of A/H9N2, 2 of A/H5N6, and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98%, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of H9 viruses to northern Vietnam rather than in-situ transmission. Further investigations of H9 prevalence and diversity in other regions of Vietnam are warranted to assess H9 endemicity elsewhere in the country.","2016-10","2016-12-12 13:25:18","2016-12-12 13:25:18","2016-12-12 13:25:18","530-540","","","44","","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/EFCVG39E/Thuy et al. - 2016 - Prevalence and diversity of H9N2 avian influenza i.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/T87P34WC/S1567134816302623.html","","","H5; H9N2; Poultry; Vietnam; Chicken; Zoonotic; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant progress was recently made in the collection of poultry census and live-poultry market data, which are key potential factors in the distribution of both diseases. Here we compiled and reprocessed a new set of poultry census data and used these to analyse HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 distributions with boosted regression trees models.

In addition, the models fitted for the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 viruses predict a high risk of disease presence for the area around Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Rice fields in the subcontinent are used by at least 351 species, although only 2.7% of birds occurring in the subcontinent breed in rice fields. The spread of rice cultivation and its attendant secondary habitats may have contributed to the increase in range and population of 64 common species but is threatening hundreds of other species, many of conservation concern. Most work in the region has focused on birds as pests of rice. Few studies have been conducted on the habits of birds that use rice fields and fewer still have compared how rice fields and similar natural habitats differ. Although rice harvesting has caused nest mortality for breeding birds, there is no comparable information from natural habitats. The guild structure of birds in rice fields is similar to that overall in the region except for a higher representation of carnivores. Rice fields are used primarily by grassland and wetland species. There are large information gaps that require filling to be able to ascertain the utility or impact of rice fields to bird populations and, thus, many research opportunities.","2010","2017-01-09 16:00:23","2017-01-09 16:00:23","2017-01-09 16:00:23","44-70","","","33","","Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SZEGHA5H/Sundar and Subramanya - 2010 - Bird Use of Rice Fields in the Indian Subcontinent.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review, we discuss the dominance of the haemagglutinin cleavage site motif as a pathogenicity determinant, the host‐pathogen molecular interactions driving cleavage activation, reverse genetics manipulations and identification of residues key to haemagglutinin cleavage site functionality and the mechanisms of cell and tissue damage during H5N1 infection. We specifically focus on the disease in chickens, as it is in this species that high pathogenicity frequently evolves and from which transmission to the human population occurs.

The H6 HA1, M and NS subtype A genes were more divergent; both nucleotide and amino acid divergence levels were similar to those of the same genes from gallinaceous poultry and mammalian origin type A influenza isolates. Phylogenetically none of the genes assorted geographically (within North America), chronologically or by species of origin, unlike isolates from non-natural host species, suggesting that selection pressure is low.

Avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in Bangladesh has been passive, relying on poultry farmers to report suspected outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza. Here, the results of an active surveillance effort focusing on the semi-scavenging ducks are presented. Result A total of 2100 cloacal swabs and 2100 sera were collected from semi-scavenging ducks from three wintering-sites of Bangladesh during three successive winter seasons, December through February in the years between 2009 and 2012. Virus isolation and identification were carried out from the cloacal swabs by virus propagation in embryonated hen eggs followed by amplification of viral RNA using Avian influenza virus (AIV) specific RT-PCR. The overall prevalence of avian influenza type A was 22.05% for swab samples and 39.76% ducks were sero-positive for avian influenza type A antibody. Extremely low sero-prevalence (0.09%) of AIV H5N1 was detected. Conclusions Based on our surveillance results, we conclude that semi-scavenging ducks in Bangladesh might play important role in transmitting Avian Influenza virus (AIV) type A. However, the current risk of infection for humans from domestic ducks in Bangladesh is negligible. We believe that this relatively large dataset over three winters in Bangladesh might create a strong foundation for future studies of AIV prevalence, evolution, and ecology in wintering sites around the globe.","2013-10-07","2017-01-13 01:49:40","2017-01-13 01:49:40","2017-01-13 01:49:40","196","","","9","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24099526 PMCID: PMC3851913","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SG8ER5RX/Khatun et al. - 2013 - Surveillance of avian influenza virus type A in se.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851913/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.","1992-03-01","2017-01-06 06:03:30","2017-01-06 06:03:30","2017-01-06 06:03:30","152-179","","1","56","","Microbiol.

Human and avian influenza A viruses differ in their recognition of host cell receptors: the former preferentially recognize receptors with saccharides terminating in sialic acid-α2,6-galactose (SAα2,6Gal), whereas the latter prefer those ending in SAα2,3Gal (refs 3–6). A conversion from SAα2,3Gal to SAα2,6Gal recognition is thought to be one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic. By identifying mutations in the receptor-binding haemagglutinin (HA) molecule that would enable avian H5N1 viruses to recognize human-type host cell receptors, it may be possible to predict (and thus to increase preparedness for) the emergence of pandemic viruses. Here we show that some H5N1 viruses isolated from humans can bind to both human and avian receptors, in contrast to those isolated from chickens and ducks, which recognize the avian receptors exclusively. Mutations at positions 182 and 192 independently convert the HAs of H5N1 viruses known to recognize the avian receptor to ones that recognize the human receptor. Analysis of the crystal structure of the HA from an H5N1 virus used in our genetic experiments shows that the locations of these amino acids in the HA molecule are compatible with an effect on receptor binding. The amino acid changes that we identify might serve as molecular markers for assessing the pandemic potential of H5N1 field isolates.","2006-11-16","2017-01-10 07:26:40","2017-01-10 07:26:40","2017-01-10 07:26:40","378-382","","7117","444","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","© 2006 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WQMGFQZD/nature05264.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following the first outbreak reported in Indonesian poultry farms in December 2003, the virus spilled over to 27 Indonesian provinces by June 2006, and became endemic in the country. In the following years, repeated sporadic human infections in Indonesia had been attributed to H5N1 HPAI viruses. Nonetheless, the viral evolution and transmission have not been fully understood. Here, we report phylogenetic evidence of a group of interlineage reassortant viruses isolated from human and cats in Java. Our comparative study of the reassortant viruses and one group of genetic parents found that although their rates of evolution were similar and both of their phylogenies were not geographically structured within mainland Java, the growths of genetic diversity were different. We also detected significant positive selection on the viral matrix and polymerase genes preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, which might correspond to viral adaptation. Based on our findings, we discuss the possibility of host switching in facilitating the emergence of the reassortant strain, and call for more extensive viral surveillances in the non-avian population in Indonesia.","2008-08-22","2017-01-10 04:48:32","2017-01-10 04:48:32","2017-01-10 04:48:32","e1000130","","8","4","","PLOS Pathogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9A5BE8M8/Lam et al. - 2008 - Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Reassort.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MJ6RP6GC/article.html","","","H5N1; Indonesia; Phylogenetic analysis; Phylogeography; Animal phylogenetics; Cats; Java; Microbial genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study demonstrates that Mexican low pathogenicity (LP) H5N2-AIVs are constantly undergoing genetic drifts. Recent AIV isolates (2002–2006) show significant molecular drifts when compared with the H5N2 vaccine-strain or other field isolates (1994–2000). This study also demonstrates that molecular drifts in the HA gene lineages follow a yearly trend, suggesting gradually cumulative sequence mutations.

Emergence of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain, causing severe disease and mortality in wild birds, poultry and humans, had raised concerns about the role of wild birds in possible transmission of the disease. In this review, the link between rice production systems, poultry production systems, and wild bird ecology is examined to assess the extent to which these interactions could contribute towards the persistence and evolution of HPAI H5N1. The rice (Oryza sativa) and poultry production systems in Asia described, and then migration and movements of wild birds discussed. Mixed farming systems in Asia and wild bird movement and migration patterns create opportunities for the persistence of low pathogenic AIVs in these systems.Nonetheless, there is no evidence of long-term persistence of HPAI viruses (including the H5N1 subtype) in the wild. There are still significant gaps in the understanding of how AIVs circulate in rice systems. A better understanding of persistence of AIVs in rice farms, particularly of poultry origins, is essential in limiting exchange of AIVs between mixed-farming systems, poultry and wild birds.","2010","2017-01-09 15:57:13","2017-01-09 15:57:13","2017-01-09 15:57:13","219-230","","","33","","Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology","Rice Production Systems and Avian Influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/22QCNS9S/Muzaffar et al. - 2010 - Rice Production Systems and Avian Influenza Inter.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Circulation among hosts may allow H5N1 virus to acquire amino acid changes enabling efficient bird-human transmission and eventually human-human transmission. The receptor specificity of viral hemagglutinin (HA) is considered a main factor affecting efficient transmissibility. Several amino acid substitutions in H5 virus HAs that increase their human-type receptor specificity have been described in virus isolates from patients, but their prevalence has been limited. In contrast, we show here that new H5 sublineages in Egypt have acquired a change in receptor specificity during their diversification in birds. We found that viruses in those sublineages exhibited increased attachment and infectivity in the human lower respiratory tract, but not in the larynx.

As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion.

All these HPAIV share the H5 or H7 subtype. In order to investigate whether the acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site by an avirulent avian influenza virus strain with a hemagglutinin other than H5 or H7 is sufficient for immediate transformation into an HPAIV, we adapted the hemagglutinin cleavage site of A/Duck/Ukraine/1/1963 (H3N8) to that of the HPAIV A/Chicken/Italy/8/98 (H5N2), A/Chicken/HongKong/220/97 (H5N1), or A/Chicken/Germany/R28/03 (H7N7) and generated the recombinant wild-type and cleavage site mutants. In contrast to the wild type, multicycle replication of these mutants in tissue culture was demonstrated by positive plaque assays and viral multiplication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. Therefore, in vitro all cleavage site mutants resemble an HPAIV. However, in chicken they did not exhibit high pathogenicity, although they could be reisolated from cloacal swabs to some extent, indicating enhanced replication in vivo. These results demonstrate that beyond the polybasic hemagglutinin cleavage site, the virulence of HPAIV in chicken is based on additional pathogenicity determinants within the hemagglutinin itself or in the other viral proteins. Taken together, these observations support the notion that acquisition of a polybasic hemagglutinin cleavage site by an avirulent strain with a non-H5/H7 subtype is only one among several alterations necessary for evolution into an HPAIV.","2009-06","2017-01-08 07:47:37","2017-01-08 07:47:37","","5864-5868","","11","83","","J.

We analyzed the incidence and spatial–temporal distribution of human brucellosis during 1955–2014 in China using notifiable surveillance data: aggregated data for 1955–2003 and individual case data for 2004–2014. A total of 513,034 brucellosis cases were recorded, of which 99.3% were reported in northern China during 1955–2014, and 69.1% (258, 462/374, 141) occurred during February–July in 1990–2014. Incidence remained high during 1955–1978 (interquartile range 0.42–1.0 cases/100,000 residents), then decreased dramatically in 1979–1994. However, brucellosis has reemerged since 1995 (interquartile range 0.11–0.23 in 1995–2003 and 1.48–2.89 in 2004–2014); the historical high occurred in 2014, and the affected area expanded from northern pastureland provinces to the adjacent grassland and agricultural areas, then to southern coastal and southwestern areas. Control strategies in China should be adjusted to account for these changes by adopting a One Health approach.","","2017-01-19 08:22:13","2017-01-19 08:22:13","2017-01-19 08:22:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","wwwnc.cdc.gov","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The introduction of Eurasian lineage HP H5 clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 IAV and subsequent reassortment with low-pathogenic H?N2 and H?N1 North American wild bird-origin IAVs in late 2014 resulted in widespread HP H5Nx IAV infections and outbreaks in poultry and wild birds across two-thirds of North America starting in November 2014 and continuing through June 2015. Although the stamping out strategies adopted by the poultry industry and animal health authorities in Canada and the United States—which included culling, quarantining, increased biosecurity, and abstention from vaccine use—were successful in eradicating the HP H5Nx viruses from poultry, these activities do not explain the apparent disappearance of these viruses from migratory waterfowl. Here we examine current and historical aquatic bird IAV surveillance and outbreaks of HP H5Nx in poultry in the United States and Canada, providing additional evidence of unresolved mechanisms that restrict the emergence and perpetuation of HP avian influenza viruses in these natural reservoirs.","2016-08-09","2017-01-31 03:45:43","2017-01-31 03:45:43","","9033-9038","","32","113","","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/T9QRUS3I/PNAS-2016-Krauss-9033-8.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improved predictions of population distribution changes over time require the use of a limited number of covariates that are time-invariant or temporally explicit. Here we make use of recently released multi-temporal high-resolution global settlement layers, historical census data and latest developments in population distribution modelling methods to reconstruct population distribution changes over 30 years across the Kenyan Coast. We explore the methodological challenges associated with the production of gridded population distribution time-series in data-scarce countries and show that trade-offs have to be found between spatial and temporal resolutions when selecting the best modelling approach.

Distinct spatial patterns in poultry and wild birds suggest that different environmental drivers and potentially different spread mechanisms are operating. However, previous studies found no difference between these two outbreak types when only the effect of physical environmental factors was analysed. The influence of physical and anthropogenic environmental variables and interactions between the two has only been investigated for wild bird outbreaks. We therefore tested the effect of these environmental factors on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, and the potential spread mechanism, and discussed how these differ from those observed in wild birds. Logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and environmental factors. Poultry outbreaks increased with an increasing human population density combined with close proximity to lakes or wetlands, increased temperatures and reduced precipitation during the cold season. A risk map was generated based on the identified key factors. In wild birds, outbreaks were strongly associated with an increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and lower elevation, though they were similarly affected by climatic conditions as poultry outbreaks. This is the first study that analyses the differences in environmental drivers and spread mechanisms between poultry and wild bird outbreaks. Outbreaks in poultry mostly occurred in areas where the location of farms or trade areas overlapped with habitats for wild birds, whereas outbreaks in wild birds were mainly found in areas where food and shelters are available. The different environmental drivers suggest that different spread mechanisms might be involved: HPAI H5N1 spread to poultry via both poultry and wild birds, whereas contact with wild birds alone seems to drive the outbreaks in wild birds.","2013-01-07","2017-02-06 10:25:44","2017-02-06 10:25:44","2017-02-06 10:25:44","e53362","","1","8","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/W2W44VR7/Si et al. - 2013 - Different Environmental Drivers of Highly Pathogen.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/68CU63AI/article.html","","","Birds; Europe; H5N1; Population Density; Poultry; Lakes; Wetlands; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A H5N1 and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences.","2009-09-25","2017-02-09 02:21:52","2017-02-09 02:21:52","2017-02-09 02:21:52","e1000520","","9","5","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4USG865M/Lemey et al. - 2009 - Bayesian Phylogeography Finds Its Roots.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BZ885XV6/article.html","","","phylogenetics; viral evolution; Phylogenetic analysis; Phylogeography; Evolutionary genetics; Animal phylogenetics; Rabies virus; avian influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, little is known about polar bear species history. Future conservation strategies would significantly benefit from an understanding of basic evolutionary information, such as the timing and conditions of their initial divergence from brown bears (U. arctos) or their response to previous environmental change. Results We used a spatially explicit phylogeographic model to estimate the dynamics of 242 brown bear and polar bear matrilines sampled throughout the last 120,000 years and across their present and past geographic ranges. Our results show that the present distribution of these matrilines was shaped by a combination of regional stability and rapid, long-distance dispersal from ice-age refugia. In addition, hybridization between polar bears and brown bears may have occurred multiple times throughout the Late Pleistocene. Conclusions The reconstructed matrilineal history of brown and polar bears has two striking features. First, it is punctuated by dramatic and discrete climate-driven dispersal events. Second, opportunistic mating between these two species as their ranges overlapped has left a strong genetic imprint. In particular, a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear matriline. This suggests that interspecific hybridization not only may be more common than previously considered but may be a mechanism by which species deal with marginal habitats during periods of environmental deterioration.","2011-08-09","2017-02-09 02:26:01","2017-02-09 02:26:01","2017-02-09 02:26:01","1251-1258","","15","21","","Current Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QGCZ8IRT/Edwards et al. - 2011 - Ancient Hybridization and an Irish Origin for the .pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/U22PS7JN/S0960982211006452.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, malaria intervention across Africa remains focused on rural, highly endemic communities with far fewer strategic policy directions for the control of malaria in rapidly growing African urban settlements. The complex and heterogeneous nature of urban malaria requires a better understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of urban malaria risk in order to design effective urban malaria control programs. In this study, we use remotely sensed variables and other environmental covariates to examine the predictability of intra-urban variations of malaria infection risk across the rapidly growing city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between 2006 and 2014. Methods High resolution SPOT satellite imagery was used to identify urban environmental factors associated malaria prevalence in Dar es Salaam. Supervised classification with a random forest classifier was used to develop high resolution land cover classes that were combined with malaria parasite prevalence data to identify environmental factors that influence localized heterogeneity of malaria transmission and develop a high resolution predictive malaria risk map of Dar es Salaam. Results Results indicate that the risk of malaria infection varied across the city. The risk of infection increased away from the city centre with lower parasite prevalence predicted in administrative units in the city centre compared to administrative units in the peri-urban suburbs. The variation in malaria risk within Dar es Salaam was shown to be influenced by varying environmental factors. Higher malaria risks were associated with proximity to dense vegetation, inland water and wet/swampy areas while lower risk of infection was predicted in densely built-up areas. Conclusions The predictive maps produced can serve as valuable resources for municipal councils aiming to shrink the extents of malaria across cities, target resources for vector control or intensify mosquito and disease surveillance. The semi-automated modelling process developed can be replicated in other urban areas to identify factors that influence heterogeneity in malaria risk patterns and detect vulnerable zones. There is a definite need to expand research into the unique epidemiology of malaria transmission in urban areas for focal elimination and sustained control agendas.

The Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses found that the H5 segment common to the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses readily reassorts with other influenza viruses (see the Perspective by Russell). H5 is thus a continual source of new pathogenic variants. These data also show that the H5N8 virus that recently caused serious outbreaks in European and North American poultry farms came from migrant ducks, swans, and geese that meet at their Arctic breeding grounds. Because the virus is so infectious, culling wild birds is not an effective control measure. Science, this issue p. 213; see also p. 174 Avian influenza viruses affect both poultry production and public health. A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) virus, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in 2014–2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses in migratory waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.

Knowledge of the evolution of receptor-binding specificity of these viruses, which might affect host range, is urgently needed. We report that emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor-binding specificity. In contrast to ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides because of substitutions K222Q and S227R, which are unique for highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins.

The accumulation of acquired immunity with age is hypothesized to affect how influenza viruses emerge and spread in species of different lifespans. Despite its importance for understanding the behaviour of avian influenza viruses, little is known about age-related accumulation of immunity in the virus's primary reservoir, wild birds. To address this, we studied the age structure of immune responses to avian influenza virus in a wild swan population (Cygnus olor), before and after the population experienced an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in 2008. We performed haemagglutination inhibition assays on sampled sera for five avian influenza strains and show that breadth of response accumulates with age. The observed age-related distribution of antibody responses to avian influenza strains may explain the age-dependent mortality observed during the highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreak. Age structures and species lifespan are probably important determinants of viral epidemiology and virulence in birds.","2016-12-28","2017-02-13 05:31:59","2017-02-13 05:31:59","2017-02-13 05:31:59","20162159","","1845","283","","Proc.

Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the ‘independent errors’ assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species’ distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species’ distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.","2012-10-01","2017-03-23 09:54:28","2017-03-23 09:54:28","2017-03-23 09:54:28","879-888","","10","35","","Ecography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9J7FX627/Crase et al. - 2012 - A new method for dealing with residual spatial aut.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We classify practices according to efficiency, substitution, and redesign. We analyse their advantages and drawbacks with emphasis on diversification. We evaluate the potential use of the practices for future agriculture. Our major findings are: (1) we distinguish 15 categories of agroecological practices (7 practices involve increasing efficiency or substitution, and 8 practices need a redesign often based on diversification). (2) The following agroecological practices are so far poorly integrated in actual agriculture: biofertilisers; natural pesticides; crop choice and rotations; intercropping and relay intercropping; agroforestry with timber, fruit, or nut trees; allelopathic plants; direct seeding into living cover crops or mulch; and integration of semi-natural landscape elements at field and farm or their management at landscape scale.

Our objective was to assess the clinical severity of human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus, which emerged in China in early 2013. Methods We obtained information about laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported as of May 28, 2013, from an integrated database built by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients who required hospital admission for medical reasons. We also used information about laboratory-confirmed cases detected through sentinel influenza-like illness surveillance to estimate the symptomatic case fatality risk. Findings Of 123 patients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection who were admitted to hospital, 37 (30%) had died and 69 (56%) had recovered by May 28, 2013. After we accounted for incomplete data for 17 patients who were still in hospital, we estimated the fatality risk for all ages to be 36% (95% CI 26–45) on admission to hospital. Risks of mechanical ventilation or fatality (69%, 95% CI 60–77) and of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or fatality (83%, 76–90) were high. With assumptions about coverage of the sentinel surveillance network and health-care-seeking behaviour for patients with influenza-like illness associated with influenza A H7N9 virus infection, and pro-rata extrapolation, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 (63–460) and 2800 (1000–9400) per 100 000 symptomatic cases. Interpretation Human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus seem to be less serious than has been previously reported. Many mild cases might already have occurred. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection.

However, there is no spatially explicit and continuous rice-planting information in either country. This knowledge gap clearly hinders our ability to understand the effects of spatial paddy rice area dynamics on the environment, such as food and water security, climate change, and zoonotic infectious disease transmission. To resolve this problem, we first generated annual maps of paddy rice planting areas for both countries from 2000 to 2015, which are derived from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the phenology- and pixel-based rice mapping platform (RICE-MODIS), and analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of paddy rice dynamics in the two countries. We found that China experienced a general decrease in paddy rice planting area with a rate of 0.72 million (m) ha/yr from 2000 to 2015, while a significant increase at a rate of 0.27 m ha/yr for the same time period happened in India. The spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in China shifted northeastward significantly, due to simultaneous expansions in paddy rice planting areas in northeastern China and contractions in southern China. India showed an expansion of paddy rice areas across the entire country, particularly in the northwestern region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain located in north India and the central and south plateau of India. In general, there has been a northwesterly shift in the spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in India. These changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice planting area have raised new concerns on how the shift may affect national food security and environmental issues relevant to water, climate, and biodiversity.","2017-02-01","2017-03-30 11:52:22","2017-03-30 11:52:22","2017-03-30 11:52:22","82-92","","","579","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/TNTT4GGB/Zhang et al. - 2017 - Spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice croplands in.pdf","","","food security; China; India; MODIS; Paddy rice agriculture; Phenology-based algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A central question is to determine regions that are likely sources of newly emerging influenza strains with pandemic causing potential. A suitable candidate is Bangladesh, being one of the most densely populated countries in the world and having an intensifying farming system. It is therefore vital to establish the key factors, specific to Bangladesh, that enable both continued transmission within poultry and spillover across the human–animal interface. We apply a modelling framework to H5N1 epidemics in the Dhaka region of Bangladesh, occurring from 2007 onwards, that resulted in large outbreaks in the poultry sector and a limited number of confirmed human cases. This model consisted of separate poultry transmission and zoonotic transmission components. Utilising poultry farm spatial and population information a set of competing nested models of varying complexity were fitted to the observed case data, with parameter inference carried out using Bayesian methodology and goodness-of-fit verified by stochastic simulations. For the poultry transmission component, successfully identifying a model of minimal complexity, which enabled the accurate prediction of the size and spatial distribution of cases in H5N1 outbreaks, was found to be dependent on the administration level being analysed. A consistent outcome of non-optimal reporting of infected premises materialised in each poultry epidemic of interest, though across the outbreaks analysed there were substantial differences in the estimated transmission parameters. The zoonotic transmission component found the main contributor to spillover transmission of H5N1 in Bangladesh was found to differ from one poultry epidemic to another. We conclude by discussing possible explanations for these discrepancies in transmission behaviour between epidemics, such as changes in surveillance sensitivity and biosecurity practices.","2017","2017-04-03 14:45:52","2018-04-16 08:48:39","2017-04-03 14:45:52","37-55","","","20","","Epidemics","Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/NCD6S8V4/Hill et al. - Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales.pdf","","","Mathematical modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild waterfowl are considered to be the reservoir for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses; however, relatively little is known about their movement ecology in regions where HPAI H5N1 outbreaks regularly occur. We studied movements of the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), a wild migratory waterfowl species that was infected in the 2005 Qinghai Lake outbreak. We defined their migration with Brownian Bridge utilization distribution models and their breeding and wintering grounds with fixed kernel home ranges. We correlated their movements with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, poultry density, land cover, and latitude in the Central Asian Flyway. Our Akaike Information Criterion analysis indicated that outbreaks were correlated with land cover, latitude, and poultry density. Although shelduck movements were included in the top two models, they were not a top parameter selected in AICc stepwise regression results. However, timing of outbreaks suggested that outbreaks in the flyway began during the winter in poultry with spillover to wild birds during the spring migration. Thus, studies of the movement ecology of wild birds in areas with persistent HPAI H5N1 outbreaks may contribute to understanding their role in transmission of this disease.","2013-09-09","2017-05-11 14:57:47","2017-05-11 14:57:47","","2129-2152","","9","5","","Viruses","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24022072 PMCID: PMC3798894","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022072","","Animal Migration; Animals, Wild; Anseriformes; Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Poultry Diseases; Asia; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the potential for two hosts of HPAI H5N1, the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and ruddy shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), to act as agents for virus dispersal along this 'thoroughfare'. We used an eco-virological approach to compare the migration of 141 birds marked with GPS satellite transmitters during 2005-2010 with: 1) the spatio-temporal patterns of poultry and wild bird outbreaks of HPAI H5N1, and 2) the trajectory of the virus in the outbreak region based on phylogeographic mapping. We found that biweekly utilization distributions (UDs) for 19.2% of bar-headed geese and 46.2% of ruddy shelduck were significantly associated with outbreaks. Ruddy shelduck showed highest correlation with poultry outbreaks owing to their wintering distribution in South Asia, where there is considerable opportunity for HPAI H5N1 spillover from poultry. Both species showed correlation with wild bird outbreaks during the spring migration, suggesting they may be involved in the northward movement of the virus. However, phylogeographic mapping of HPAI H5N1 clades 2.2 and 2.3 did not support dissemination of the virus in a northern direction along the migration corridor. In particular, two subclades (2.2.1 and 2.3.2) moved in a strictly southern direction in contrast to our spatio-temporal analysis of bird migration. Our attempt to reconcile the disciplines of wild bird ecology and HPAI H5N1 virology highlights prospects offered by both approaches as well as their limitations.","2012","2017-05-11 14:59:24","2017-05-11 14:59:24","","e30636","","2","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22347393 PMCID: PMC3274535","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22347393","","Animal Migration; Animals, Wild; Geese; Geography; Incidence; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Asia, Central; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.","2011-03-09","2017-05-11 14:59:48","2017-05-11 14:59:48","","e17622","","3","6","","PLoS ONE","Wild bird migration across the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21408010 PMCID: PMC3052365","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21408010","","Animal Migration; Animals, Wild; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Geese; Geography; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Phylogeny; Regression Analysis; Seasons; Breeding; Fresh Water; Wetlands; Tibet; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work in Southeast Asia demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 risk is related to domestic ducks and people. Other studies discussed the role of migratory birds in the long distance spread of HPAI H5N1. However, the interplay between local persistence and long-distance dispersal has never been studied. We expand previous geospatial risk analysis to include South and Southeast Asia, and integrate the analysis with migration data of satellite-tracked wild waterfowl along the Central Asia flyway. We find that the population of domestic duck is the main factor delineating areas at risk of HPAI H5N1 spread in domestic poultry in South Asia, and that other risk factors, such as human population and chicken density, are associated with HPAI H5N1 risk within those areas. We also find that satellite tracked birds (Ruddy Shelduck and two Bar-headed Geese) reveal a direct spatio-temporal link between the HPAI H5N1 hot-spots identified in India and Bangladesh through our risk model, and the wild bird outbreaks in May-June-July 2009 in China (Qinghai Lake), Mongolia, and Russia. This suggests that the continental-scale dynamics of HPAI H5N1 are structured as a number of persistence areas delineated by domestic ducks, connected by rare transmission through migratory waterfowl.","2010-12","2017-05-11 15:00:05","2017-05-11 15:00:05","","448-458","","4","7","","Ecohealth","Flying over an infected landscape","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21267626 PMCID: PMC3166606","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21267626","","Algorithms; Animal Migration; Asia, Southeastern; Bangladesh; China; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Vectors; Environmental Health; Humans; India; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Logistic Models; Public Health Practice; Remote Sensing Technology; Spacecraft; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission. Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised concerns about the potential of resilient free-ranging birds to disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of information about their migratory ecology. During 2007-08 we marked wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the location and timing of spring migration and identify any spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal (Anas falcata), Baikal teal (Anas formosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), garganey (Anas querquedula), and Chinese spotbill (Anas poecilohyncha). These wild ducks (excluding the resident mallard and Chinese spotbill ducks) followed the East Asian Flyway along the coast to breeding areas in northern China, eastern Mongolia, and eastern Russia. None migrated west toward Qinghai Lake (site of the largest wild bird epizootic), thus failing to demonstrate any migratory connection to the Central Asian Flyway. A newly developed Brownian bridge spatial analysis indicated that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported in the flyway were related to latitude and poultry density but not to the core migration corridor or to wetland habitats. Also, we found a temporal mismatch between timing of outbreaks and wild duck movements. These analyses depend on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks, but by documenting movements of wild waterfowl, we present ecological knowledge that better informs epidemiological investigations seeking to explain and predict the spread of avian influenza viruses.","2010-03","2017-05-11 15:00:23","2017-05-11 15:00:23","","466-476","","1 Suppl","54","","Avian Dis.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 20521681 PMCID: PMC4878034","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521681","","Animal Migration; Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Asia; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The death of wild swans (Cygnus spp.) has been the first indicator of the presence of H5N1 in various Asian and European countries; however their role in the geographic spread of the disease remains poorly understood. We marked 10 whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) with GPS transmitters in northeastern Mongolia during autumn 2006 and tracked their migratory movements in relation to H5N1 outbreaks. The prevalence of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry in eastern Asia during 2003-2007 peaked during winter, concurrent with whooper swan movements into regions of high poultry density. However outbreaks involving poultry were detected year round, indicating disease perpetuation independent of migratory waterbird presence. In contrast, H5N1 outbreaks involving whooper swans, as well as other migratory waterbirds that succumbed to the disease in eastern Asia, tended to occur during seasons (late spring and summer) and in habitats (areas of natural vegetation) where their potential for contact with poultry is very low to nonexistent. Given what is known about the susceptibility of swans to H5N1, and on the basis of the chronology and rates of whooper swan migration movements, we conclude that although there is broad spatial overlap between whooper swan distributions and H5N1 outbreak locations in eastern Asia, the likelihood of direct transmission between these groups is extremely low. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that swans are best viewed as sentinel species, and moreover, that in eastern Asia, it is most likely that their infections occurred through contact with asymptomatic migratory hosts (e.g., wild ducks) at or near their breeding grounds.","2009-05-28","2017-05-11 15:00:35","2017-05-11 15:00:35","","e5729","","5","4","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 19479053 PMCID: PMC2684635","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19479053","","Animal Migration; Anseriformes; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Far East; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Poyang Lake, China, domestic duck production cycles are synchronized with arrival and departure of thousands of migratory wild birds in the area. During these periods, high densities of juvenile domestic ducks are in close proximity to migratory wild ducks, increasing the potential for the virus to be transmitted and subsequently disseminated via migration. In this paper, we use GPS dataloggers and dynamic Brownian bridge models to describe movements and habitat use of free-grazing domestic ducks in the Poyang Lake basin and identify specific areas that may have the highest risk of H5N1 transmission between domestic and wild birds. Specifically, we determine relative use by free-grazing domestic ducks of natural wetlands, which are the most heavily used areas by migratory wild ducks, and of rice paddies, which provide habitat for resident wild ducks and lower densities of migratory wild ducks. To our knowledge, this is the first movement study on domestic ducks, and our data show potential for free-grazing domestic ducks from farms located near natural wetlands to come in contact with wild waterfowl, thereby increasing the risk for disease transmission. This study provides an example of the importance of movement ecology studies in understanding dynamics such as disease transmission on a complicated landscape.","2016","2017-05-11 15:36:28","2017-05-11 15:36:28","","869-880","","5","30","","Int J Geogr Inf Sci","Movement analysis of free-grazing domestic ducks in Poyang Lake, China","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27695384 PMCID: PMC5042146","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27695384","","disease transmission; domestic poultry; dynamic Brownian bridge movement model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1-km resolution global product that provides scale-integrated and accuracy-weighted consensus land-cover information on an approximately continuous scale. Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.","2014-09-01","2017-05-16 07:19:54","2017-05-16 07:19:54","2017-05-16 07:19:54","1031-1045","","9","23","","Global Ecology and Biogeography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/EIS97PKJ/Tuanmu and Jetz - 2014 - A global 1-km consensus land-cover product for bio.pdf","","","Remote sensing; species distribution models; DISCover; GLC2000; GlobCover; land-cover heterogeneity; land-cover prevalence; MODIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China.   Methods and findings In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km2 cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC > 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9.   Conclusions We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections.","2017-04-04","2017-05-17 06:30:44","2017-05-17 06:30:44","2017-05-17 06:30:44","e0174980","","4","12","","PLOS ONE","Influenza A H5N1 and H7N9 in China","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/AMARRXNC/Bui et al. - 2017 - Influenza A H5N1 and H7N9 in China A spatial risk.pdf","","","China; H7N9; Infectious disease control; agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a primitive computer model of the Earth system, they concluded that by the early decades of the 21st century, tangible limits to key global resources would begin to emerge. A reanalysis of the original results in 2008 found that the original global resource depletion projections were remarkably accurate ( 2 ). Since then, Rockström et al. ( 3 ) have defined a new term—planetary boundaries—to describe nine variables of high importance to habitability of Earth, including climate change, ocean acidification, land-use change, and biodiversity loss. These metrics are compelling conceptually, but many are not easily measured globally; explicitly defining a critical boundary is even more challenging. I suggest a new planetary boundary, terrestrial net primary (plant) production (NPP), that may be as compelling conceptually, integrates many of the currently defined variables, and is supported by an existing global data set for defining boundaries.","2012-09-21","2017-05-18 07:22:39","2017-05-18 07:22:39","2017-05-18 07:22:39","1458-1459","","6101","337","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2012, American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","science.sciencemag.org","","PMID: 22997311","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/K6REVBZN/Running - 2012 - A Measurable Planetary Boundary for the Biosphere.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22997311","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we used a fuzzy method to create a hybrid wetland map for China through the combination of five existing wetlands datasets, including four spatially explicit wetland distribution data and one wetland census. Our results show the total wetland area is 384,864 km2, 4.08% of China’s national surface area. The hybrid wetland map also shows spatial distribution of wetlands with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The reliability of the map is demonstrated by comparing it with spatially explicit datasets on lakes and reservoirs. The hybrid wetland map is by far the first wetland mapping that is consistent with the statistical data at the national and provincial levels in China. It provides a benchmark map for research on wetland protection and management.

The first human infection case was confirmed in Shanghai City and soon spread across most of eastern China. Using the methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM), this research quantitatively analyzed the relationships between the H7N9 occurrence and the main environmental factors, including meteorological variables, human population density, bird migratory routes, wetland distribution, and live poultry farms, markets, and processing factories. Based on these relationships the probability of the presence of H7N9 was predicted. Results indicated that the distribution of live poultry processing factories, farms, and human population density were the top three most important determinants of the H7N9 human infection. The relative contributions to the model of live poultry processing factories, farms and human population density were 39.9%, 17.7% and 17.7%, respectively, while the maximum temperature of the warmest month and mean relative humidity had nearly no contribution to the model. The paper has developed an ecological niche model (ENM) that predicts the spatial distribution of H7N9 cases in China using environmental variables. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the model were greater than 0.9 (0.992 for the training samples and 0.961 for the test data). The findings indicated that most of the high risk areas were distributed in the Yangtze River Delta. These findings have important significance for the Chinese government to enhance the environmental surveillance at multiple human poultry interfaces in the high risk area.","2016-06-16","2017-05-30 08:53:36","2017-05-30 08:53:36","","","","6","13","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27322296 PMCID: PMC4924057","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322296","","environmental factors; spatial modeling; avian flu; MaxEnt; H7N9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that the epidemic spread with significant spatial-temporal autocorrelation. In order to describe the spatial-temporal autocorrelation of H7N9, an improved model was developed by introducing a spatial-temporal factor in this paper. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to investigate the risk factors associated with their distribution, and nine risk factors were significantly associated with the occurrence of A(H7N9) human infections: the spatial-temporal factor φ (OR = 2546669.382, p < 0.001), migration route (OR = 0.993, p < 0.01), river (OR = 0.861, p < 0.001), lake(OR = 0.992, p < 0.001), road (OR = 0.906, p < 0.001), railway (OR = 0.980, p < 0.001), temperature (OR = 1.170, p < 0.01), precipitation (OR = 0.615, p < 0.001) and relative humidity (OR = 1.337, p < 0.001). The improved model obtained a better prediction performance and a higher fitting accuracy than the traditional model: in the improved model 90.1% (91/101) of the cases during February 2014 occurred in the high risk areas (the predictive risk > 0.70) of the predictive risk map, whereas 44.6% (45/101) of which overlaid on the high risk areas (the predictive risk > 0.70) for the traditional model, and the fitting accuracy of the improved model was 91.6% which was superior to the traditional model (86.1%). The predictive risk map generated based on the improved model revealed that the east and southeast of China were the high risk areas of A(H7N9) human infections in February 2014. These results provided baseline data for the control and prevention of future human infections.","2015-12-01","2017-05-30 08:57:18","2017-05-30 08:57:18","","15204-15221","","12","12","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","A Predictive Risk Model for A(H7N9) Human Infections Based on Spatial-Temporal Autocorrelation and Risk Factors","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26633446 PMCID: PMC4690917","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26633446","","China; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Influenza, Human; Logistic Models; Risk Factors; Spatial analysis; H7N9; Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype; logistic regression modelling; spatial-temporal autocorrelation; Risk assessment; geographic mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, very little is known about the spatiotemporal variability or environmental drivers of the risk of H7N9 infection. This study explored the spatial and temporal variation of H7N9 infection and assessed the effects of temperature and rainfall on H7N9 incidence. METHODS: A Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the risk of H7N9 infection in Shanghai, by district and fortnight for the period 19th February-14th April 2013. Data on daily laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases, and weather variability including temperature (°C) and rainfall (mm) were obtained from the Chinese Information System for Diseases Control and Prevention and Chinese Meteorological Data Sharing Service System, respectively, and aggregated by fortnight. RESULTS: High spatial variations in the H7N9 risk were mainly observed in the east and centre of Shanghai municipality. H7N9 incidence rate was significantly associated with fortnightly mean temperature (Relative Risk (RR): 1.54; 95% credible interval (CI): 1.22-1.94) and fortnightly mean rainfall (RR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.47-5.56). CONCLUSION: There was a substantial variation in the spatiotemporal distribution of H7N9 infection across different districts in Shanghai. Optimal temperature and rainfall may be one of the driving forces for H7N9.","2015-01","2017-05-30 08:57:25","2017-05-30 08:57:25","","405-412","","","136","","Environ.

The objective of this study was to predict the risk of future human infections with H7N9 in China and neighboring countries by assessing the association between H7N9 cases at sentinel hospitals and putative agricultural, climatic, and demographic risk factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the locations of H7N9 cases and negative cases from China's influenza-like illness surveillance network. After identifying H7N9 risk factors with logistic regression, we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to construct predictive maps of H7N9 risk across Asia. RESULTS: Live bird market density was associated with human H7N9 infections reported in China from March-May 2013. Based on these cases, our model accurately predicted the virus' spread into Guangxi autonomous region in February 2014. Outside China, we find there is a high risk that the virus will spread to northern Vietnam, due to the import of poultry from China. CONCLUSIONS: Our risk map can focus efforts to improve surveillance in poultry and humans, which may facilitate early identification and treatment of human cases.","2014-08","2017-05-30 08:57:34","2017-05-30 08:57:34","","174-181","","2","69","","J.

To illustrate the dynamics of viral spread, we created a thematic map displaying the distribution of affected counties and plotted epidemic curves for the three most affected provinces and the whole country. We then collected data of agro-ecological, environmental and meteorological factors at the county level, and used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to examine the relative contribution of each factor and map the probability of occurrence of human H7N9 infection. We found that live poultry markets, human population density, irrigated croplands, built-up land, relative humidity and temperature significantly contributed to the occurrence of human infection with H7N9 virus. The discriminatory ability of the model was up to 97.4%. A map showing the areas with high risk for human H7N9 infection was created based on the model.

This H7N9 subtype virus has since infected 240 people and killed 60, and has awakened global concern as a potential pandemic threat. Ecological niche modeling has seen increasing applications as a useful tool in mapping geographic potential and risk of disease transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS: We developed two datasets based on seasonal variation in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODIS sensor to characterize environmental dimensions of H7N9 virus. One-third of well-documented cases was used to test robustness of models calibrated based on the remaining two-thirds, and model significance was tested using partial ROC approaches. A final niche model was calibrated using all records available. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Central-eastern China appears to represent an area of high risk for H7N9 spread, but suitable areas were distributed more spottily in the north and only along the coast in the south; highly suitable areas also were identified in western Taiwan. Areas identified as presenting high risk for H7N9 spread tend to present consistent NDVI values through the year, whereas unsuitable areas show greater seasonal variation.","2014","2017-05-30 08:57:49","2017-05-30 08:57:49","","e93390","","4","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24690878 PMCID: PMC3972139","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690878","","China; Disease Outbreaks; Environment; Humans; Influenza, Human; Models, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons; Geography, Medical; Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype; geographic mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first human infection case was confirmed in Shanghai City and soon spread across most of eastern China. Using the methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM), this research quantitatively analyzed the relationships between the H7N9 occurrence and the main environmental factors, including meteorological variables, human population density, bird migratory routes, wetland distribution, and live poultry farms, markets, and processing factories. Based on these relationships the probability of the presence of H7N9 was predicted. Results indicated that the distribution of live poultry processing factories, farms, and human population density were the top three most important determinants of the H7N9 human infection. The relative contributions to the model of live poultry processing factories, farms and human population density were 39.9%, 17.7% and 17.7%, respectively, while the maximum temperature of the warmest month and mean relative humidity had nearly no contribution to the model. The paper has developed an ecological niche model (ENM) that predicts the spatial distribution of H7N9 cases in China using environmental variables. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the model were greater than 0.9 (0.992 for the training samples and 0.961 for the test data). The findings indicated that most of the high risk areas were distributed in the Yangtze River Delta. These findings have important significance for the Chinese government to enhance the environmental surveillance at multiple human poultry interfaces in the high risk area.","2016-06-16","2017-05-30 08:57:58","2017-05-30 08:57:58","","","","6","13","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27322296 PMCID: PMC4924057","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322296","","environmental factors; spatial modeling; avian flu; MaxEnt; H7N9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in mainland China stopped H7N9 outbreaks temporarily, closures are difficult to sustain, in view of poultry production and marketing systems in China. In this Personal View, we summarise interventions taken in mainland China, and provide evidence for other more sustainable but effective interventions in the live poultry market systems that reduce risk of zoonotic influenza including rest days, and banning live poultry in markets overnight. Separation of live ducks and geese from land-based (ie, non-aquatic) poultry in LPM systems can reduce the risk of emergence of zoonotic and epizootic viruses at source. In view of evidence that H7N9 is now endemic in over half of the provinces in mainland China and will continue to cause recurrent zoonotic disease in the winter months, such interventions should receive high priority in China and other Asian countries at risk of H7N9 through cross-border poultry movements. Such generic measures are likely to reduce known and future threats of zoonotic influenza.","2016-02","2017-06-01 14:04:26","2017-06-01 14:04:26","","252-258","","2","16","","Lancet Infect Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26654122","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26654122","","Communicable Disease Control; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Influenza in Birds; Risk Factors; Pandemics; Asia; Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype; Zoonoses; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large epidemic in 2016–17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016–17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of Feb 23, 2017, from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Between Feb 19, 2013, and Feb 23, 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013–14, 219 in 2014–15, 114 in 2015–16, and 447 in 2016–17. The 2016–17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41% (55 of 134) to 57% (254 of 447) from the first epidemic to the 2016–17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 epidemics (63% [72 of 114] and 61% [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the first three epidemics (39% [52 of 134], 55% [169 of 306], and 56% [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016–17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Age distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection with A H7N9 virus.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars.</p>","2017-06-02","2017-06-04 08:17:37","2017-06-04 08:17:37","2017-06-04 08:17:37","","","0","0","","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","Epidemiology of avian influenza A H7N9 virus in human beings across five epidemics in mainland China, 2013–17","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BQHXSRFZ/Xiling Wang_2017_Lancet ID_Epidemiology of H7N9 across five epidemics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We distinguished two different systems (1) stationary duck flocks that are not commonly driven to rice fields beyond village boundaries and that are confined overnight on farms and (2) moving duck flocks that are intentionally driven to rice fields beyond village boundaries, that are not returning to home farms for extended periods and that are housed overnight in temporary enclosures in rice paddies. A total of 115 stationary and 22 moving flock farmers were interviewed in 2007 in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam. Moving duck flocks are larger than stationary flocks, which is indicative of their more commercial production. Moving flock farmers apparently are more aware of HPAI risks than stationary flock farmers, as their flocks are more likely fully vaccinated and have less contact with chickens during scavenging. On the other hand, the spread of HPAI virus between birds might be promoted by moving duck flocks as they repeatedly use transport vehicles and numerous rice paddies for scavenging and are often visited by hatchery owners in the field for purchasing duck eggs. In addition, long distances travelled by moving duck flocks might also result in widespread dissemination of HPAI virus. Further studies are necessary to describe HPAI prevalence and travel patterns of moving duck flocks and to explore the moving duck flock network in detail.","2013-03","2017-06-08 09:51:46","2017-06-08 09:51:46","","837-848","","3","45","","Trop Anim Health Prod","Characteristics of two duck farming systems in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23086602","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23086602","","Disease Outbreaks; Female; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza in Birds; Male; Poultry Diseases; Prevalence; Risk Factors; animal husbandry; Surveys and Questionnaires; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Countries endemically affected with HPAI in Asia are characterised by production systems where ducks are fed on post-harvest spilled rice. During this scavenging process it is common for ducks to come into contact with other duck flocks or wild birds, thereby providing opportunities for virus spread. Effective risk management for HPAI has been significantly compromised by a limited understanding of management of moving duck flocks in these countries, despite of a small number of recent investigations. Here, for the first time, we described the management of moving duck flocks and the structure of the moving duck flock network in quantitative terms so that factors influencing the risk of HPAIV transmission can be identified. By following moving duck flock farmers over a period of 6 months in Java, Indonesia, we were able to describe the movement of flocks and to characterise the network of various types of actors associated with the production system. We used these data to estimate the basic reproductive number for HPAI virus spread. Our results suggest that focussing HPAI prevention measures on duck flocks alone will not be sufficient. Instead, the role of transporters of moving duck flocks, hatcheries and rice paddy owners, in the spread of the HPAI virus needs to be recognised.","2016","2017-06-08 09:53:34","2017-06-08 09:53:34","","e0152123","","3","11","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27019344 PMCID: PMC4809517","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27019344","","Antibodies, Viral; Disease Outbreaks; Geographic Information Systems; Indonesia; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Poultry Diseases; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, mechanisms driving this variation in wild birds have yet to be tested. We investigated the validity of three previously suggested drivers for the seasonal dynamics in LPAIV infections in wild birds: (i) host density, (ii) immunologically naïve young and (iii) increased susceptibility in migrants. To address these questions, we sampled a key LPAIV host species, the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, on a small spatial scale, comprehensively throughout a complete annual cycle, measuring both current and past infection (i.e. viral and seroprevalence, respectively). We demonstrate a minor peak in LPAIV prevalence in summer, a dominant peak in autumn, during which half of the sampled population was infected, and no infections in spring. Seroprevalence of antibodies to a conserved gene segment of avian influenza virus (AIV) peaked in winter and again in spring. The summer peak of LPAIV prevalence coincided with the entrance of unfledged naïve young in the population. Moreover, juveniles were more likely to be infected, shed higher quantities of virus and were less likely to have detectable antibodies to AIV than adult birds. The arrival of migratory birds, as identified by stable hydrogen isotope analysis, appeared to drive the autumn peak in LPAIV infection, with both temporal coincidence and higher infection prevalence in migrants. Remarkably, seroprevalence in migrants was substantially lower than viral prevalence throughout autumn migration, further indicating that each wave of migrants amplified local AIV circulation. Finally, while host abundance increased throughout autumn, it peaked in winter, showing no direct correspondence with either of the LPAIV infection peaks. At an epidemiologically relevant spatial scale, we provide strong evidence for the role of migratory birds as key drivers for seasonal epizootics of LPAIV, regardless of their role as vectors of these viruses. This study exemplifies the importance of understanding host demography and migratory behaviour when examining seasonal drivers of infection in wildlife populations.","2014-01","2017-06-09 10:50:19","2017-06-09 10:50:19","","266-275","","1","83","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24033258 PMCID: PMC3869896","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24033258","","Animal Migration; Influenza in Birds; Seasons; Seroepidemiologic Studies; influenza A virus; Epidemics; Aging; CT-value; age; infection intensity; infectious disease; nucleoprotein; origin; subtype; viral prevalence; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of wild birds in the spread of HPAI H5N1 has previously been investigated by comparing disease spread patterns with bird migration routes. However, the different roles that the southward autumn and northward spring migration might play in virus transmission have hardly been explored. Using direction analysis, we analyze HPAI H5N1 transmission directions and angular concentration of currently circulating viral clades, and compare these with waterfowl seasonal migration directions along major waterfowl flyways. Out of 22 HPAI H5N1 transmission directions, 18 had both a southward direction and a relatively high concentration. Differences between disease transmission and waterfowl migration directions were significantly smaller for autumn than for spring migration. The four northward transmission directions were found along Asian flyways, where the initial epicenter of the virus was located. We suggest waterfowl first picked up the virus from East Asia, then brought it to the north via spring migration, and then spread it to other parts of world mainly by autumn migration. We emphasize waterfowl autumn migration plays a relatively important role in HPAI H5N1 transmission compared to spring migration.","2016-08-10","2017-06-09 10:51:21","2017-06-09 10:51:21","","30262","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27507581 PMCID: PMC4978953","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27507581","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify demographic determinants and spatiotemporal patterns of AIV infection in long distance migratory waterfowl in North America, we fitted generalized linear models with binominal distribution to analyze results from 13,574 blue-winged teal (Anas discors, BWTE) sampled in 2007 to 2010 year round during AIV surveillance programs in Canada and the United States. Our analyses revealed that during late summer staging (July-August) and fall migration (September-October), hatch year (HY) birds were more likely to be infected than after hatch year (AHY) birds, however there was no difference between age categories for the remainder of the year (winter, spring migration, and breeding period), likely due to maturing immune systems and newly acquired immunity of HY birds. Probability of infection increased non-linearly with latitude, and was highest in late summer prior to fall migration when densities of birds and the proportion of susceptible HY birds in the population are highest. Birds in the Central and Mississippi flyways were more likely to be infected compared to those in the Atlantic flyway. Seasonal cycles and spatial variation of AIV infection were largely driven by the dynamics of AIV infection in HY birds, which had more prominent cycles and spatial variation in infection compared to AHY birds. Our results demonstrate demographic as well as seasonal, latitudinal and flyway trends across Canada and the US, while illustrating the importance of migratory host life cycle and age in driving cyclical patterns of prevalence.","2015","2017-06-09 10:53:08","2017-06-09 10:53:08","","e0130662","","6","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26110538 PMCID: PMC4481355","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26110538","","Animal Migration; Animals, Wild; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Prevalence; Life Cycle Stages; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Influenza viruses were isolated mainly from fecal samples of dabbling ducks in their nesting places in central Alaska. The numbers of subtypes of 108 influenza virus isolates were 1 H2N3, 37 H3N8, 55 H4N6, 1 H7N3, 1 H8N2, 1 H10N2, 11 H10N7, and H10N9. Influenza viruses were also isolated from water samples of the lakes where they nest. Even in September of 1994 when the most ducks had left for migration to south, viruses were still isolated from the lake water. Phylogenetic analysis of the NP genes of the representative isolates showed that they belong to the North American lineage of avian influenza viruses, suggesting that the majority of the waterfowls breeding in central Alaska migrate to North America and not to Asia. The present results support the notion that influenza viruses have been maintained in waterfowl population by water-borne transmission and revealed the mechanism of year-by-year perpetuation of the viruses in the lakes where they breed.","1995-07-01","2017-06-09 11:18:46","2017-06-09 11:18:46","2017-06-09 11:18:46","1163-1172","","7","140","","Archives of Virology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/82NVE2I3/Ito et al. - 1995 - Perpetuation of influenza A viruses in Alaskan wat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevalence dynamics were influenced by year, but retained a common pattern for all years whereby prevalence was low in spring and summer, but increased in early autumn with a first peak in August, and a second more pronounced peak during October–November. A total of 74 haemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) combinations were isolated, including all NA and most HA (H1–H12) subtypes. The most common subtype combinations were H4N6, H1N1, H2N3, H5N2, H6N2 and H11N9, and showed a clear linkage between specific HA and NA subtypes. Furthermore, there was a temporal structuring of subtypes within seasons based on HA phylogenetic relatedness. Dissimilar HA subtypes tended to have different temporal occurrence within seasons, where the subtypes that dominated in early autumn were rare in late autumn, and vice versa.

In California, flooded rice fields are used by numerous aquatic birds during winter. If this habitat functions similarly to more natural wetlands, increased flooding may help replace the extensive wetlands that occurred in the region prior to agricultural development. I tested whether food abundance, perceived predation threat, foraging performance, and the way in which birds allocate their time to different behaviors differed between flooded rice fields and seminatural wetlands for several species of aquatic bird. When appropriate, I also compared flooded and unflooded fields. Invertebrate densities did not differ among habitats. Seminatural wetlands had less rice grain but more seeds from other plants than the two rice habitats. The frequency with which predators passed over a feeding area was lower in flooded fields than in unflooded fields or seminatural wetlands. Most differences in feeding performance and time allocation among habitats were small and statistically insignificant. For some species, feeding efficiency was greater in seminatural wetlands than in flooded fields. Increasing attack rates and the amount of time spent feeding when in flooded fields, however, may allow birds to compensate for reduced efficiency. Multivariate analyses showed that group size, predation threat, time of day, date, and water depth often were associated with behaviors, but that these variables rarely accounted for habitat differences. Flooded fields apparently provide equivalent foraging habitat to seminatural wetlands and, because of reduced predation threat, may be a safer habitat for waterbirds. Thus, if managed appropriately, one of the world's dominant forms of agriculture can provide valuable waterbird habitat.","2000-02-01","2017-06-14 07:30:49","2017-06-14 07:30:49","2017-06-14 07:30:49","181-191","","1","14","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/G43UMVXC/Elphick - 2000 - Functional Equivalency between Rice Fields and Sem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A flyway perspective is critical for understanding how wild birds contribute to the persistence of AIV over large spatial and temporal scales, with implications for how to focus surveillance efforts and identify risks to public health.

Previous occurrences in Europe of HPNAI H5N1 in these avian populations have involved exclusively viruses from clade 2.2. This represents the most westerly spread of clade 2.3.2 viruses, which have shown an apparently expanding range of geographical dispersal since mid-2009 following confirmation of infections in wild waterfowl species in Mongolia and Eastern Russia. During March 2010, AI infection was suspected at post-mortem examination of two hens from two backyard flocks in Tulcea Country, Romania. HPNAI of H5N1 subtype was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A second outbreak was confirmed 2 weeks later by RT-PCR, affecting all hens from another flock located 55 km east of the first cluster. On the same day, an H5N1 HPNAI virus was detected from a pooled tissue sample collected from a dead Common Buzzard found on the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria. Detailed genetic characterization of the haemagglutinin gene revealed the cleavage site of the isolates to be consistent with viruses of high pathogenicity belonging to clade 2.3.2 of the contemporary Eurasian H5N1 lineage. Viruses from a clade other than 2.2 have apparently spread to wild birds, with potential maintenance and spread through such populations. Whilst the scale of threat posed by the apparent westward spread of the clade 2.3.2 viruses remains uncertain, ongoing vigilance for clinical signs of disease as part of existing passive surveillance frameworks for AI, and the prompt reporting of suspect cases in poultry is advised.","2011-02","2017-06-14 11:01:25","2017-06-14 11:01:25","","76-78","","1","58","","Transbound Emerg Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21054819 PMCID: PMC3582342","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21054819","","Animals, Wild; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Disease Outbreaks; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Romania; Bulgaria; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the study of virulence evolution and the development of theories towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist, but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed, involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those originally considered. Many processes such as pathogen adaptation to within-host competition, interactions with the immune system and shifting transmission routes, will all be interrelated making sweeping evolutionary predictions harder to obtain. We argue that this is the heart of the current debate in the field and while species-specific models may be better predictive tools, the trade-off hypothesis and its basic extensions are necessary to assess the qualitative impacts of virulence management strategies.","2009-02-01","2017-07-04 11:06:59","2017-07-04 11:06:59","2017-07-04 11:06:59","245-259","","2","22","","","Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/X2W8WND2/Alizon et al. - 2009 - Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis .pdf","","","transmission; Evolution; Virulence; immune response; multiple infections; recovery; trade-off","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

H.","History of highly pathogenic avian influenza","Revue Scientifique Et Technique (International Office of Epizootics)","","0253-1933","","","The most widely quoted date for the beginning of the recorded history of avian influenza (AI) is 1878, when researchers first differentiated a disease of poultry (initially known as fowl plague but later renamed highly pathogenic avian influenza) from other diseases with high mortality rates. Current evidence indicates that highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) viruses arise through mutation after low pathogenicity AI viruses of H5 or H7 subtype are introduced into poultry. Between 1877 and 1958, a number of epizootics of HPAI occurred in most parts of the world. From 1959 to 1995, the emergence of HPAI viruses was recorded on 15 occasions, but losses were minimal. In contrast, between 1996 and 2008, HPAI viruses emerged at least 11 times and four of these outbreaks involved many millions of birds. Events during this recent period are overshadowed by the current epizootic of HPAI due to an H5N1 virus that has spread throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, affecting over 60 countries and causing the loss of hundreds of millions of birds. All sectors of the poultry population have been affected, but free-range commercial ducks, village poultry, live bird markets and fighting cocks seem especially significant in the spread of the virus. The role of wild birds has been extensively debated but it is likely that both wild birds and domestic poultry are responsible for its spread. Even without these H5N1 outbreaks, the period 1995 to 2008 will be considered significant in the history of HPAI because of the vast numbers of birds that died or were culled in three of the other ten epizootics during this time.","2009-04","2017-07-04 12:07:46","2017-07-04 12:07:46","","19-38","","1","28","","Rev. - Off.

Data from 3264 notifications for acute Q fever in the period from 2007 through 2009 were analysed. The patients most affected were men, smokers and persons aged 40–60 years. Pneumonia was the most common clinical presentation (62% in 2007 and 2008). Only 3.2% of the patients were working in the agriculture sector and 0.5% in the meat-processing industry including abattoirs. Dairy goat farms with Coxiella burnetii-induced abortion waves were mainly located in the same area where human cases occurred. Airborne transmission of contaminated dust particles from commercial dairy goat farms in densely populated areas has probably caused this epidemic. In 2010, there was a sharp decline in the number of notified cases following the implementation of control measures on dairy goat and sheep farms such as vaccination, hygiene measures and culling of pregnant animals on infected farms.

The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20% to 40% of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20% of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited.","2015-12-22","2017-07-04 12:26:07","2017-07-04 12:26:07","","222","","","12","","Virol.

A large epidemic in 2016–17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016–17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of Feb 23, 2017, from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Between Feb 19, 2013, and Feb 23, 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013–14, 219 in 2014–15, 114 in 2015–16, and 447 in 2016–17. The 2016–17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41% (55 of 134) to 57% (254 of 447) from the first epidemic to the 2016–17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 epidemics (63% [72 of 114] and 61% [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the first three epidemics (39% [52 of 134], 55% [169 of 306], and 56% [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016–17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Age distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection with A H7N9 virus.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars.</p>","2017-06-02","2017-07-10 12:35:07","2017-07-10 12:35:07","2017-07-10 12:35:07","","","0","0","","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","Epidemiology of avian influenza A H7N9 virus in human beings across five epidemics in mainland China, 2013–17","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","PMID: 28583578, 28583578","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/I7ZXU88G/Wang et al. - 2017 - Epidemiology of avian influenza A H7N9 virus in hu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583578,%2028583578","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outdoor-layer, turkey (meat and breeder), and duck (meat and breeder) farms had a significantly higher risk for LPAIV introduction than did indoor-layer farms. Except for outdoor-layer, all poultry types (i.e., broilers, chicken breeders, ducks, and turkeys) are kept indoors. For all production types, LPAIV risk decreased significantly with increasing distance to medium-sized waterways and with increasing distance to areas with defined wild waterfowl, but only for outdoor-layer and turkey farms. Future research should focus not only on production types but also on distance to waterways and wild bird areas. In addition, settlement of new poultry farms in high-risk areas should be discouraged.","","2017-08-18 07:22:24","2017-08-18 07:22:24","2017-08-18 07:22:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","wwwnc.cdc.gov","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows that small farms (less than 2ha) operate about 12% and family farms about 75% of the world’s agricultural land. It shows that average farm size decreased in most low- and lower-middle-income countries for which data are available from 1960 to 2000, whereas average farm sizes increased from 1960 to 2000 in some upper-middle-income countries and in nearly all high-income countries for which we have information. Such estimates help inform agricultural development strategies, although the estimates are limited by the data available.

Developing and maintaining sufficiently high-quality data resources is expensive and time consuming. Statistical modelling of population density and distribution has only begun to be applied to farm animal populations, although it is commonly used in wildlife ecology. We developed zero-inflated Poisson regression models in a Bayesian framework using environmental and socioeconomic variables to predict the counts of livestock units (LSUs) and of cattle on spatially referenced farm polygons in a commercially available New Zealand farm database, Agribase. Farm-level counts of cattle and of LSUs varied considerably by region, because of the heterogeneous farming landscape in New Zealand. The amount of high quality pasture per farm was significantly associated with the presence of both cattle and LSUs. Internal model validation (predictive performance) showed that the models were able to predict the count of the animal population on groups of farms that were located in randomly selected 3km zones with a high level of accuracy. Predicting cattle or LSU counts on individual farms was less accurate. Predicted counts were statistically significantly more variable for farms that were contract grazing dry stock, such as replacement dairy heifers and dairy cattle not currently producing milk, compared with other farm types. This analysis presents a way to predict numbers of LSUs and cattle for farms using environmental and socio-economic data. The technique has the potential to be extrapolated to predicting other pastoral based livestock species.","2017-09-15","2017-08-30 07:24:38","2017-08-30 07:24:38","2017-08-30 07:24:38","121-132","","","145","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3DR5D5GG/van Andel et al. - 2017 - Predicting farm-level animal populations using env.pdf","","","spatial epidemiology; Biosecurity; Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation; Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression; Species distribution modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet few, if any, countries can afford to maintain comprehensive, up-to-date agricultural census data. Statistical modelling can be used as a proxy for such data but comparative modelling studies have rarely been undertaken for livestock populations. Widespread species, including livestock, can be difficult to model effectively due to complex spatial distributions that do not respond predictably to environmental gradients. We assessed three machine learning species distribution models (SDM) for their capacity to estimate national-level farm animal population numbers within property boundaries: boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF) and K-nearest neighbour (K-NN). The models were built from a commercial livestock database and environmental and socio-economic predictor data for New Zealand. We used two spatial data stratifications to test (i) support for decision making in an emergency response situation, and (ii) the ability for the models to predict to new geographic regions. The performance of the three model types varied substantially, but the best performing models showed very high accuracy. BRTs had the best performance overall, but RF performed equally well or better in many simulations; RFs were superior at predicting livestock numbers for all but very large commercial farms. K-NN performed poorly relative to both RF and BRT in all simulations. The predictions of both multi species and single species models for farms and within hypothetical quarantine zones were very close to observed data. These models are generally applicable for livestock estimation with broad applications in disease risk modelling, biosecurity, policy and planning.","2017-08-24","2017-09-05 08:48:34","2017-09-05 08:48:34","2017-09-05 08:48:34","e0183626","","8","12","","PLOS ONE","Species distribution models","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.plos.org","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3VCPBTJT/Hollings et al. - 2017 - Species distribution models A comparison of stati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of wind in disease spread, through its effect on <i>Culicoides</i> dispersal, is still uncertain, and remains unquantified. We examine here the relationship between farm-level infection dates and wind speed and direction within the framework of a novel model involving both mechanistic and stochastic steps. We consider wind as both a carrier of host semio-chemicals, to which midges might respond by upwind flight, and as a transporter of the midges themselves, in a more or less downwind direction. For completeness, we also consider midge movement independent of wind and various combinations of upwind, downwind and random movements. Using stochastic simulation, we are able to explain infection onset at 94 per cent of the 2025 affected farms. We conclude that 54 per cent of outbreaks occurred through (presumably midge) movement of infections over distances of no more than 5 km, 92 per cent over distances of no more than 31 km and only 2 per cent over any greater distances. The modal value for all infections combined is less than 1 km. Our analysis suggests that previous claims for a higher frequency of long-distance infections are unfounded. We suggest that many apparent long-distance infections resulted from sequences of shorter-range infections; a ‘stepping stone’ effect. Our analysis also found that downwind movement (the only sort so far considered in explanations of BT epidemics) is responsible for only 39 per cent of all infections, and highlights the effective contribution to disease spread of upwind midge movement, which accounted for 38 per cent of all infections. The importance of midge flight speed is also investigated. Within the same model framework, lower midge active flight speed (of 0.13 rather than 0.5 m s<sup>−1</sup>) reduced virtually to zero the role of upwind movement, mainly because modelled wind speeds in the area concerned were usually greater than such flight speed. Our analysis, therefore, highlights the need to improve our knowledge of midge flight speed in field situations, which is still very poorly understood. Finally, the model returned an intrinsic incubation period of 8 days, in accordance with the values reported in the literature. We argue that better understanding of the movement of infected insect vectors is an important ingredient in the management of future outbreaks of BT in Europe, and other devastating vector-borne diseases elsewhere.</p>","2012-06-22","2017-09-05 09:58:07","2017-09-05 09:58:07","2017-09-05 09:58:07","2354-2362","","1737","279","","","","","","","","","","en","This journal is © 2012 The Royal Society","","","","rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org","","PMID: 22319128","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/IX9DCSQZ/Sedda et al. - 2012 - A new algorithm quantifies the roles of wind and m.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of these routes has implications for disease control, because we can often restrict host movement, and so potentially reduce spread, but cannot easily restrict insect movements. Despite this, the importance of host movements has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical model which allows us to disentangle and quantify transmission by insect dispersal and by host movement. We apply the model to two diseases of cattle and sheep transmitted by biting midges that have emerged in northern Europe in the past decade, bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). For both viruses, we show insect movements account for a majority of spread between farms. Although they cannot sustain an epidemic on their own, animal movements play an important role in introducing disease to new areas.","2017-04-03","2017-09-05 10:05:04","2017-09-05 10:05:04","2017-09-05 10:05:04","e1005470","","4","13","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.plos.org","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/F6NDKS6R/Sumner et al. - 2017 - Quantifying the roles of host movement and vector .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in order to implement effective control measures, it is important to understand the movement network in a given area. Using the SANITEL data from 2005 to 2009, around 2 million cattle movements in Belgium were traced. Exploratory analysis revealed different spatial structures for the movement of different cattle types: fattening calves are mostly moved to the Antwerp region, adult cattle are moved to different parts in Belgium. Based on these differences, movement of cattle would more likely cause a spread of disease to a larger number of areas in Belgium as compared to the fattening calves. A closer inspection of the spatial and temporal patterns of cattle movement using a weighted negative binomial model, revealed a significant short-distance movement of bovine which could be an important factor contributing to the local spreading of a disease. The model however revealed hot spot areas of movement in Belgium; four areas in the Walloon region (Luxembourg, Hainaut, Namur and Liege) were found as hot spot areas while East and West Flanders are important “receivers” of movement. This implies that an introduction of a disease to these Walloon regions could result in a spread toward the East and West Flanders regions, as what happened in the case of Bluetongue BTV-8 outbreak in 2006. The temporal component in the model also revealed a linear trend and short- and long-term seasonality in the cattle movement with a peak around spring and autumn. The result of this explorative analysis enabled the identification of “hot spots” in time and space which is important in enhancing any existing monitoring and surveillance system.","2014-09-01","2017-09-05 10:07:01","2017-09-05 10:07:01","2017-09-05 10:07:01","89-101","","1","116","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ICH8J998/Ensoy et al. - 2014 - Exploring cattle movements in Belgium.pdf","","","Spatial; Bluetongue; Cattle movement; Temporal; Weighted Negative binomial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using information on the 2006 Bluetongue outbreak in cattle farms in Belgium, a spatio-temporal transmission model was formulated. The model quantifies the local transmission of the disease between farms within a municipality, the short-distance transmission between farms across neighbouring municipalities and the transmission as a result of cattle movement. Different municipality-level covariates such as farm density, land composition variables, temperature and precipitation, were assessed as possibly influencing each component of the transmission process. Results showed a significant influence of the different covariates in each model component, particularly the significant effect of temperature and precipitation values in the number of infected farms. The model which allowed us to predict the dynamic spreading of BTV for different movement restriction scenarios, also affirmed the significant impact of cattle movement in the 2006 BTV outbreak pattern.

To propose targeted control strategies as alternative to massive vaccination, there is a need to better understand how BT virus spread in space and time according to local characteristics of host and vector populations. Our objective was to assess, using a modelling approach, how spatiotemporal heterogeneities in abundance and distribution of hosts and vectors impact the occurrence and amplitude of local and regional BT epidemics. We built a reaction–diffusion model accounting for the seasonality in vector abundance and the active dispersal of vectors. Because of the scale chosen, and movement restrictions imposed during epidemics, host movements and wind-induced passive vector movements were neglected. Four levels of complexity were addressed using a theoretical approach, from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous environment in abundance and distribution of hosts and vectors. These scenarios were illustrated using data on abundance and distribution of hosts and vectors in a real geographical area. We have shown that local epidemics can occur earlier and be larger in scale far from the primary case rather than close to it. Moreover, spatial heterogeneities in hosts and vectors delay the epidemic peak and decrease the infection prevalence. The results obtained on a real area confirmed those obtained on a theoretical domain. Although developed to represent BTV spatiotemporal spread, our model can be used to study other vector-borne diseases of animals with a local to regional spread by vector diffusion.","2013-06-19","2017-09-05 10:09:58","2017-09-05 10:09:58","2017-09-05 10:09:58","44","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","En","2013 Charron et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/INKM29RH/Charron et al. - 2013 - Seasonal and spatial heterogeneities in host and v.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viet Nam has a large number of LBMs reflecting the consumer preferences for live poultry. Under pressure to mitigate risks for H7N9 and other zoonotic avian influenzas, Viet Nam is considering, among other mitigation measures, temporary closures of LBMs as a policy to reduce risk of AI outbreaks. However, the efficacy of market closure is debated, particularly because little is known about how poultry traders may react, and whether trading may emerge outside formal marketplaces. Combining efforts of anthropologists, economists, sociologists and veterinarians can be useful to elucidate the drivers behind poultry traders’ reactions and better understanding the barriers to implementing risk mitigation measures. In this paper, we present results from a stakeholder survey of LBM stakeholders in Viet Nam. Our qualitative data show that trading outside formal markets is very likely to occur in the event of a temporary LBM market closure. Our data show that the poultry value chain in Viet Nam remains highly flexible, with traders willing and able to trade poultry in many possible locations. Our results indicate that simplification of the poultry value chain along with strict enforcement, engagement of stakeholders and adequate communication would be a necessary prerequisite before market closure could be an effective policy.","2017","2017-09-12 07:36:43","2017-09-12 07:36:43","2017-09-12 07:36:43","","","","4","","Front.

In this study we paired census microdata from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with additional spatial datasets to develop models for the internal migration flows in each country, including key drivers that reflect the changing social, demographic, economic, and environmental landscapes. We assessed how well these gravity-type spatial interaction models can both explain and predict migration. Results show that the models can explain up to 87 percent of internal migration, can predict future within-country migration with correlations of up to 0.91, and can also predict migration in other countries with correlations of up to 0.72.

A key question in rabies epidemiology is the identification of factors that impact virus dispersion. Here we apply new analytical methods, based on phylogeographic reconstructions of viral lineage movement, to undertake a comparative evolutionary-epidemiological study of the spatial dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) epidemics in different hosts and habitats. We compiled RABV data sets from skunk, raccoon, bat and domestic dog populations in order to investigate the viral diffusivity of different RABV epidemics, and to detect and compare the environmental factors that impact the velocity of viral spread in continuous spatial landscapes. We build on a recently developed statistical framework that uses spatially- and temporally-referenced phylogenies. We estimate several spatial statistics of virus spread, which reveal a higher diffusivity of RABV in domestic dogs compared with RABV in other mammals. This finding is explained by subsequent analyses of environmental heterogeneity, which indicate that factors relating to human geography play a significant role in RABV dispersion in domestic dogs. More generally, our results suggest that human-related factors are important worldwide in explaining RABV dispersion in terrestrial host species. Our study shows that phylogenetically informed viral movements can be used to elucidate the factors that impact virus dispersal, opening new opportunities for a better understanding of the impact of host species and environmental conditions on the spatial dynamics of rapidly evolving populations.","2017-10-01","2017-09-29 08:32:02","2017-09-29 08:32:02","2017-09-29 08:32:02","2563-2571","","10","34","","Mol Biol Evol","","","","","","","","","","","","","academic.oup.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KP5XWANJ/Dellicour et al. - 2017 - Using Viral Gene Sequences to Compare and Explain .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The positive perception of supporting, regulating and cultural services in mixed species stands contrasted with less conclusive results from the literature, where positive, negative and neutral effects were reported. Many respondents also signified a lack of information about regulating services. Furthermore, provisioning services were perceived as equal in mixed species stands and monocultures, in contrast to higher productivity demonstrated in mixed species stands in the literature. The regional (Flanders and Wallonia) ecological and socio-economic context influenced both the perception of ecosystem services and of the importance of management objectives.

Here, using culture-dependent and independent methods, we provide a comprehensive overview of the associated bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi of the parasitic Dendroctonus micans, D. punctatus and D. valens, and compare them to those of other tree-inhabiting insects. Despite inhabiting different geographical regions and/or host trees, the three species showed similar microbial communities. Enterobacteria were the most prevalent bacteria, in particular Rahnella, Pantoea and Ewingella, in addition to Streptomyces. Likewise, the yeasts Candida/Cyberlindnera were the most prominent fungi. All these microorganisms are widespread among tree-inhabiting insects with various ecologies, but their high prevalence overall might indicate a beneficial role such as detoxification of tree defenses, diet supplementation or protection against pathogens. As such, our results enable comparisons of symbiont communities of parasitic bark beetles with those of other beetles, and will contribute to our understanding of how microbial symbioses facilitate dietary shifts in insects.","2016-07-06","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","","","9","92","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/235673/3/Dohet_et_al_2016_final_pub_FEMSEC.pdf","Ecology; Ecologie [animale]; Entomologie; Bacteria; Biologie; Dendroctonus; Fungi; insect symbiosis; Microbiologie et protistologie [entomologie,phytoparasitolog.]; parasitic bark beetles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Eurasia, the Monotomid beetle Rhizophagus grandis is found only in the galleries of its prey, the bark beetle Dendroctonus micans. The specificity of R. grandis relies on kairomones which female predators use to adjust their oviposition to the number of prey larvae available in a gallery. Yet these chemical signals are still largely unknown. The North American D. punctatus and D. valens, which are not sympatric with R. grandis but have a similar ecology as D. micans, could also elicit predator oviposition, which would suggest that specificity in this predator-prey system is constrained by geography. In order to further identify these determinants of specificity, we used artificial oviposition boxes to compare the oviposition level of R. grandis in the presence of larvae of each of the three prey species. We jointly used sequential dynamic headspace extractions and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate oviposition stimuli associated with each prey species and potential oviposition inhibitors emitted by the predator. We further assessed potential stimuli with the analysis of emissions from D. micans larvae reared alone. Overall, we identified and quantified 67 compounds, mostly terpenes. Several robust candidate stimulants or inhibitors of R. grandis’ oviposition were identified. The three prey species elicited similar oviposition levels in R. grandis, which suggests that this predator could form new associations outside of its native range.","2017-08-01","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","778-793","","8","43","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes it difficult to assess the risks associated with this trade and to prioritise high-risk commodities (genus-origin combinations) for detailed inspection or regulation. Using the ISEFOR database, this paper describes the diversity and dynamics of P4P imports into the EU, based on genus-level data for lots imported into fourteen Member States that provided this data for different periods between 2005 and 2014, totalling over 30Bn plants and over 7500 commodities. There was great variety, as well as complementarity, in terms of the imported genera, origins and commodities among the countries. Two-thirds of the imported commodities changed every year. Based on the 10-year data from the Netherlands, the greatest importer of live plants in the dataset, we developed a risk categorisation approach for prioritising the highest risk commodities, based on risk associated information concerning the imported genus and the history of trade with respect to the exporting countries, genera and type of plant material traded. Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive phytosanitary inspections.","2017-06-07","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-10 05:00:16","1-15","","","","","Biol Invasions","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-017-1465-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information about the structure of plant trade networks is not generally available, but it is valuable for better assessing the potential risks associated with the trade in live plants and the development of prevention and mitigation measures and policy. The discovery of two larvae of Anoplophora chinensis (citrus longhorn beetle - CLB) in 2009, at a nursery importing Acer palmatum from China in one of the major Dutch tree nursery areas, has resulted in the creation of a detailed dataset on the intra- European Union trade in its potential hosts. This study describes European imports of the primary host of A. chinensis, Acer spp., into the Netherlands (1998-2012) and the effects of the finding in a tree nursery area. In addition, shipments of Acer spp. from 138 producers in the nursery area in 2009 were analysed in a one-offanalysis of intra-EU trade. The volume of Acer spp. imports from Asia was stable early during the studied period, and declined to 5% of the initial imports after a period of interceptions, illustrating the effect of regulations. The number of notifications of A. chinensis infestations in imported consignments of Acer spp. increased sharply in the years up to 2007, then declined as imports also reduced. Although plants were shipped to destinations throughout Europe, each producer shipped plants only to few destinations in few countries. Most of the plants were shipped to nurseries in EU countries. These patterns could make it easier to target these high risk destinations for control measures. The lack of transaction records makes it difficult to trace the destination of plants. More systematic electronic record keeping by traders and growers and the data being collated in a database that can be made available to regulatory authorities, together with further studies of plant trade data using network approaches, would be beneficial for improving trace-back and trace-forward and provide better safeguards for plant health and quality.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1-20","","","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/242985/3/Eschen_et_al_2015_Neobiota.pdf","international trade; Généralités; Citrus longhorn beetle (Anoplophora chinensis Forster); Invasive alien insects; Japanese maple (Acer palmatum Thunb.); Plants for planting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid introduction of harmful organisms through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that <1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the inspection increased with lot size, but the probability that the infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0.95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0.6 in the other countries. We suggest that the EU Member States adopt common maximum acceptable infestation levels and harmonized, statistics-based sampling protocols for plants for planting.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","2403-2413","","8","17","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/220713/3/Eschen_et_al_2015_Biological_Invasions.pdf","international trade; Ecologie; Evolution des espèces; European Union; International standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPM); Invasive alien species; Phytosanitary inspections; Quarantine species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For many insects, reproductive success in patchily-distributed species can be improved by sibling-mating. Inmany cases, such strategies correspond to sexual dimorphism, with males–whose reproductive activities can take place withoutdispersal–investing less energy in development of dispersive resources such as large body size and wings. This dimorphism isparticularly likely when males have little or no chance of mating outside their place of birth, such as when sperm competitionprecludes successful fertilisation in females that have already mated. The economically important bark beetle pest speciesDendroctonus micans (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) has been considered to be exclusively sibling-mating, with 90% offemales having already mated with their brothers by emergence. The species does not, however, show strong sexualdimorphism; males closely resemble females, and have been observed flying through forests. We hypothesised that this lack ofsexual dimorphism indicates that male D. micans are able to mate with unrelated females, and to sire some or all of theiroffspring, permitting extrafamilial reproduction. Using novel microsatellite markers, we carried out cross-breeding laboratoryexperiments and conducted paternity analyses of resulting offspring. Our results demonstrate that a second mating with a lessrelatedmale can indeed lead to some offspring being sired by the latecomer, but that most are sired by the first, sibling male.We discuss these findings in the context of sperm competition versus possible outbreeding depression.","2014","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","327-333","","","113","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/148343/10/x.pdf","Ecologie [animale]; Entomologie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Europe, over the period 1950-2000, insect damage (which equates mostly to bark beetles) ranked third, with 8% of the total damage due to forest disturbances. The damage amounted to 2.88 million m3 per year between 1958 and 2001. The major direct economic consequences of these outbreaks have been widely analyzed, various mitigation methods have been designed and implemented, and diverse political, industrial, and commercial initiatives have been developed to salvage the remains of the devastated forests. However, the many other environmental and sociological consequences of these disturbances are still largely unexplored. Significant progress has been made in analyzing the multi-scale positive influence of bark beetle activity, from the landscape to the stand level, as well as the various socioeconomic changes brought by bark beetle outbreaks. Silvicultural, environmental, and social consequences of bark beetle outbreaks are described and discussed, as well as the different issues related to the salvage of damaged forests. The wider context of management policies, including risk management and exotic species management, is discussed. Five case studies are presented to illustrate how biological features of specific systems lead to particular sociopolitical issues: Ips typographus in Europe; secondary ambrosia beetles attacking living beech in Europe; Dendroctonus rufipennis in Alaska; Dendroctonus ponderosae in British Columbia; and Ips pini in North America.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","585-613","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier Inc.","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/226724/1/Elsevier_210351.pdf","RISK; Généralités; Scolytinae; Bark beetle; Damage; Environmental services; Exotic species; Salvage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficiency of the HD/R strategy for both these Bt toxins. As the current two-toxin Bt plants do not express two new Cry toxins but reuse one toxin already in use with a one-toxin plant, we estimated the spread of resistance when the resistance alleles are not rare. This study assesses: (i) whether the two toxins have to be present in high concentration, and (ii) the impact of the relative size of the refuge zone on the evolution of resistance and population density. We concluded that for Bt plants expressing one toxin, a high concentration is an essential condition for resistance management. For the pyramided Bt plants, one toxin could be expressed at a low titer if the two toxins are used for the first time, and a small refuge zone is acceptable.","2012","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","810-835","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/132759/1/PMC3496990.pdf","Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sélection amélioration des plantes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we develop a deterministic model to estimate the impact of toxin concentration, emergence asynchrony and refuge zone size on the effectiveness of the HD/R strategy.

At the same time, a decline of some native coccinellid species was observed in tree habitats. One hypothesis about the cause of this decline was that it might have been due to intraguild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis. In natural conditions, IGP between coccinellids can be tracked by using defensive compounds. Exogenous alkaloids in H. axyridis were therefore examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), using individuals sampled from lime trees that were also occupied by other species of coccinellids. Harmonia axyridis was the dominant species at all life stages, in terms of both numbers of sites occupied and local abundance. The GC–MS analysis of H. axyridis larvae revealed traces of exogenous alkaloids from 19 of the 20 sites and, in nine of those 19 sites, more than 30% of the larvae analyzed contained exogenous alkaloids. Three alkaloids were detected: adaline from Adalia spp., calvine from Calvia spp. and propyleine from Propylea quatuordecimpunctata. Predation by H. axyridis on two different coccinellid species was also detected in the same larva, reinforcing the status of H. axyridis as a top predator. A generalized linear model indicated that IGP frequency was positively influenced by two variables: the abundance of extraguild and intraguild prey; and the interaction between these two variables. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that IGP by H. axyridis on native coccinellids in tree habitats has led to the decline of several of these species.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1805-1814","","","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/98407/1/Hautier%20et%20al%202011%20Biol%20Invasions.pdf","Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Entomologie; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Sylviculture; Agronomie générale; Ecologie chimique; Alkaloids, Biological control, Biological invasions, Ladybirds, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigate under what conditions participating with unrelated conspecifics in risky mass attacks on living trees is an adaptive strategy, and what this can tell us about bark beetle outbreak dynamics. We find that the outcome of individual host selection may deviate from the ideal free distribution in a way that facilitates the emergence of tree-killing (aggressive) behavior, and that any heritability on traits governing aggressiveness seems likely to exist in a state of flux or cycles consistent with variability observed in natural populations. This may have implications for how economically and ecologically important species respond to environmental changes in climate and landscape (forest) structure.

Such changes affect the dynamics of the interaction between major forest pest species, such as bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), and their host trees. Normally breeding mostly in broken or severely stressed spruce; at high population densities some bark beetle species can colonise and kill healthy trees on scales ranging from single trees in a stand to multi-annual landscape-wide outbreaks. In Eurasia, the largest outbreaks are caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (Linnaeus), which is common and shares a wide distribution with its main host, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.). A large literature is now available, from which this review aims to synthesize research relevant for the population dynamics of I. typographus and co-occurring species under changing conditions. We find that spruce bark beetle population dynamics tend to be metastable, but that mixed-species and age-heterogeneous forests with good site-matching tend to be less susceptible to large-scale outbreaks. While large accumulations of logs should be removed and/or debarked before the next swarming period, intensive removal of all coarse dead wood may be counterproductive, as it reduces the diversity of predators that in some areas may play a role in keeping I. typographus populations below the outbreak threshold, and sanitary logging frequently causes edge effects and root damage, reducing the resistance of remaining trees. It is very hard to predict the outcome of interspecific interactions due to invading beetle species or I. typographus establishing outside its current range, as they can be of varying sign and strength and may fluctuate depending on environmental factors and population phase. Most research indicates that beetle outbreaks will increase in frequency and magnitude as temperature, wind speed and precipitation variability increases, and that mitigating forestry practices should be adopted as soon as possible considering the time lags involved.","2011","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","34-51","","1","87","","","","","","","","","","other","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/92222/1/Kausrud%20et%20al%202011%20-%20Biological%20Reviews.pdf","Ecologie; Ecologie [animale]; Entomologie; Phytoparasitologie et phytopathologie; Forest pests; Population dynamics; Ips typographus; Sylviculture; Zoologie forestierecynégétique; Climate change; Forestry; Outbreak dynamics; bark beetles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we aimed to test this hypothesis further, by retrospective meteorological analyses and also by an experimental approach. 3 Our meteorological analyses highlighted the occurrence of cold waves a year before the beech declines were reported in 1929, 1942 and 1998. 4 In our experimental approach, frost injuries were inflicted to mature trees in a beech stand using dry ice. The treated trees were more attractive to insects than untreated controls. Insect attacks were observed in the treated zones on the trees but colonization was not very successful. The galleries had aborted most of the time with only a few larval chambers. Very few insects were caught in emergence traps. 5 The results of these two approaches support and strengthen the hypothesis that frost induced beech dieback. Frost injuries increased tree attraction to ambrosia beetles to the point of inducing attacks. However, the overall success of these attacks was much lower than that observed in the 2000s.

Hosts face trade-offs in the allocation of resources in growth and reproduction or in defense, and the defense/resources status varies with time after host's death or weakening event. Tree-killing bark beetles at endemic levels must choose along a spectrum, compromising between encountering minimal defense and facing high competition, or benefiting from high nutritional quality but facing high host defense. The relationships between resources and defenses in dead/dying trees have not been quantitatively assessed to date, because most studies focus on epidemic conditions. We measured the changes in constitutive and induced defenses in the phloem of spruce trees artificially uprooted at different times (up to 17 months prior to experiment initiation) and treated with methyl-jasmonate (MeJ) in order to induce chemical defense. We measured the effect of these changes on different steps of the host selection process and brood success of a major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae).Our results show that uprooted trees maintain some level of constitutive defenses, in particular monoterpenes, that decrease with time after uprooting. Moreover, the trees maintain some inducibility and can produce monoterpenes in response to MeJ treatment up to 7 months after uprooting. These defenses are correlated in part with the energy available in the phloem, but are likely too weak to exert pressure on the beetles' success and selection, the latter being related to the amount of energy available. Our results confirm that wind-felled trees are poorly defended, consistent with the hypothesis of the evolution of the tree-killing behavior from saprophagy in response to an overwhelming interspecific competition on undefended hosts. Wind-felled trees still represent a useful resource, exposing endemic populations of aggressive beetles to low defense levels while facilitating reproduction, growth and development. The constraint on the beetles' populations then becomes the ability to locate these scattered and unpredictable resources.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","44-50","","","359","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/220668/1/Elsevier_204295.pdf","Bark beetle ecology; Droit de l'environnement; Economie de l'environnement et des ressources naturelles; Endemic populations; Environnement et pollution; Inducible defenses; Ips typographus; Sylviculture; Terpenes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The longevity of these resources strongly influences population dynamics, but very little is known in this respect.We tested the hypothesis that the driving factor reducing the availability of fallen trees is the decrease of their nutritional quality. We analysed the qualitative changes of the phloem of spruces artificially uprooted at different times (2-17. month before the experiment started) and simultaneously exposed during the same flight season to attacks of the major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus.

The beetles could develop on the oldest (17. month-old) resources with no significant differences in terms of fecundity, progeny body mass and global energy acquisition.Although they retain their nutritional quality over long periods, transient resources are exposed to other factors that make them rapidly unsuitable for I. typographus.

At endemic levels, these species are restricted to poorly defended resources, such as wind-felled, lightning-struck, or suppressed trees. It is poorly understood how these scattered and unpredictable resources are discovered and exploited. In this prospect, the collective foraging shown by most bark beetles, in the form of independent searching by individual beetles combined with mutual attention to each other's chemical signals, represents an efficient strategy to increase the probability to discover the resources. In order to explore the role of host distribution and collective foraging on the discovery of and settlement on wind-felled trees by bark beetles at endemic population densities, we developed a spatially explicit foraging model for the major forest pest in Europe, Ips typographus. The model is based on the diffusion of the beetles, the landing of pioneers on wind-felled trees realistically distributed based on field observations in southern Belgium, and the response of flying beetles to pheromones emitted by these pioneers. The results show that social foraging effectively increases the proportion of beetles that landed on wind-felled resources compared to solitary foragers. Furthermore, the model highlights the parameters that influenced the foraging strategy of I. typographus and that need narrower quantification in further experiments. Finally, in the frame of the tested parameters, the model highlights the existence of thresholds in the reproduction rate and in the size of the starting population under which populations collapse. If confirmed, this prediction would shed new light on the understanding of foraging at low, endemic population levels.","2016","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","188-199","","","337","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/236493/1/Elsevier_220120.pdf","Collective behaviour; Forest pests; Population dynamics; Technologie de l'environnement, contrôle de la pollution; Thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a first step, a rearing system using eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as a food and synthetic polyester wadding as an oviposition substrate was compared with a natural rearing system using the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), as to its effects on the predator’s developmental and reproductive parameters. In a second series of experiments the performance of C. montrouzieri on bee pollen or on a mixture of E.kuehniella eggs and bee pollen was assessed. E. kuehniella eggs proved to be a suitable food to support larval development of the predator. Ladybird larvae reared on flour moth eggs developed two days faster and weighed approximately 10 % more than their counterparts reared on mealybugs. Despite a prolongation of the preoviposition period with ca. eight days and a decrease in egg hatch by about 10 %, C. montrouzieri females fed moth eggs accepted the synthetic wadding as an oviposition substrate and deposited the same number of eggs their counterparts maintained on mealybugs. A mixture of E. kuehniella eggs with pollen yielded similar developmental and reproductive rates as E. kuehniella eggs alone, but a diet of bee pollen alone was not adequate for the predator.

To investigate the impact of such traits, we focused on two Eurasian spruce bark beetles that share a similar geographical distribution, but differ in their ecology and reproduction. Ips typographus is an aggressive tree-killing species characterized by strong dispersal, whereas Dendroctonus micans is a discrete inbreeding species (sib-mating is the rule), parasite of living trees and a poor disperser. We compared genetic variation between the two species over both beetles' entire range in Eurasia with five independent gene fragments, to evaluate whether their intrinsic differences could have an influence over their phylogeographic patterns. We highlighted widely divergent patterns of genetic variation for the two species, and argue that the difference is indeed largely compatible with their contrasting dispersal strategies and modes of reproduction. In addition, genetic structure in I. typographus divides European populations in a northern and a southern group, as was previously observed for its host plant, and suggests past allopatric divergence. A long divergence time was estimated between East Asian and other populations of both species, indicating their long-standing presence in Eurasia, prior to the last glacial maximum. Finally, the strong population structure observed in D. micans for the mitochondrial locus provides insights into the recent colonization history of this species, from its native European range to regions where it was recently introduced.

Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy at the start of the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e.g. 1-30 days). Under both low (4°C after 5 days at 16°C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16°C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e.g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4°C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16°C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the oak processionary moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

They can be monogamous or polygamous, solitary or gregarious, and employ levels of parental care that range from gallery maintenance in many tribes to eusociality in some ambrosia beetles. Within this complexity, however, scolytines display some generalities that arise from reproducing within plants, such as sophisticated host location systems, morphological adaptations that facilitate tunneling, advanced communication systems that provide very specific information about plants, and close associations with microbial symbionts. Bark beetles produce pheromones that both attract mates and serve additional functions that vary with the beetles' host-plant relationships. Some species use aggregation pheromones to coordinate cooperative resource procurement, a behavior needed to overcome the sophisticated defenses of live trees. A broad array of microbial symbionts is associated with bark beetles, and these fungi and bacteria vary in their degrees of association, impacts, mechanisms, and functional substitutabilities. Some symbionts contribute to acquisition, utilization, and defense of the host plant resource, and some provide a direct food base. A wide array of predators, competitors, and parasites exploit bark beetles. Many of these natural enemies utilize chemical signals emanating from the beetles or their symbionts in host location, depending on the stage they attack. The habitat in which bark beetles reside poses significant challenges to predators and parasites, so their effects on population dynamics are often limited. Some behavioral, reproductive, and landscape patterns emerge when bark beetle species are functionally categorized by the physiological condition of host plants they colonize. Bark beetles play important and varied roles in ecosystem processes, contributing to biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and heterogeneity. They also pose challenges to resource management in both native and commercial ecosystems. The scale at which beetles exert impacts varies markedly among functional groups, with most species having very localized effects. A few species exert landscape-scale effects, and these ecosystem engineers are among the most pronounced disturbance agents of the biomes they help shape. Their population dynamics are characterized by cross-scale interactions, density-dependent feedbacks, plasticity in host selection decisions, critical thresholds at multiple levels of interaction, and multi-equilibria. A variety of anthropogenic inputs, specifically transport into new regions, habitat manipulations that homogenize forest structure or impede predators, and climatic changes such as elevated temperature and increased drought, increase the socioeconomic losses caused by both eruptive and historically noneruptive species.","2015","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1-40","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier Inc.","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/220716/1/Elsevier_204343.pdf","Ecology; Population dynamics; Biology; Généralités; Natural history; Plant defense; Scolytinae; Symbioses; bark beetles; pheromones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we compare the distribution (Belgium and Britain) and abundance (Belgium, Britain and Switzerland) of formerly common and widespread native ladybirds before and after the arrival of Harmonia axyridis, a globally rapidly expanding IAS. Location Europe Methods We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to assess the distribution trends of eight conspicuous and historically widespread and common species of ladybird within Belgium and Britain before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. The distribution data were collated largely through public participatory surveys but verified by a recognized expert. We also used GLMMs to model trends in the abundance of ladybirds using data collated through systematic surveys of deciduous trees in Belgium, Britain and Switzerland. Results Five (Belgium) and seven (Britain) of eight species studied show substantial declines attributable to the arrival of H. axyridis. Indeed, the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, declined by 30% (Belgium) and 44% (Britain) over 5years after the arrival of H. axyridis. Trends in ladybird abundance revealed similar patterns of declines across three countries. Main conclusion Together, these analyses show H. axyridis to be displacing native ladybirds with high niche overlap, probably through predation and competition. This finding provides strong evidence of a causal link between the arrival of an IAS and decline in native biodiversity. Rapid biotic homogenization at the continental scale could impact on the resilience of ecosystems and severely diminish the services they deliver. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2012-02-01","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/120391/3/120391.pdf","Ecologie; Entomologie; Harmonia axyridis, biological invasions, intra-guild predation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most empirical support for this hypothesis comes from simple structured communities that are relatively easy to manipulate. The impact of forest biodiversity on forest ecosystem functioning has been far less studied. Experiment design - In this paper, we present the recently established, large-scale FORBIO experiment (FORest BIOdiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), specifically designed to test the effects of tree species diversity on forest ecosystem functioning. FORBIO's design matches with that of the few other tree diversity experiments worldwide, but at the same time, the FORBIO experiment is unique as it consists of a similar experimental set-up at three sites in Belgium (Zedelgem, Hechtel-Eksel and Gedinne) with contrasting edaphic and climatological characteristics. This design will help to provide answers to one of the most interesting unresolved questions in functional biodiversity research, notably whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning decrease in less stressful and more productive environments. At each site, FORBIO consists of 41 to 44 plots (127 plots in total) planted with monocultures and mixtures up to four species, selected from a pool of five site-adapted, functionally different tree species. When allocating the treatments to the plots, we maximally avoided any possible covariation between environmental factors. Monitoring of ecosystem functioning already started at the Zedelgem and Gedinne sites and will start soon in Hechtel-Eksel. Multiple processes are being measured and as the trees grow older, we plan to add even more processes. Expected results - Not only basic science, but also forest management will benefit from the results coming from the FORBIO experiment, as FORBIO is, for instance, also a test case for uncommon, not well-known tree species mixtures. To conclude, FORBIO is an important ecosystem experiment that has the potential to deliver badly needed insights into the multiple relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which will be valuable for both science and practice. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.","2013","2017-10-13 20:17:00","2017-10-13 20:17:00","","1-10","","1","146","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Ecologie; Sylviculture; Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research; Field experiment; Forest ecology; Forest management; Mixed forest; Tree diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to characterize the Mexican 2012 H7N3 HPAI virus (A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA1/2012) and determine the protection against the virus conferred by different H7 inactivated vaccines in chickens. Both adult and young chickens intranasally inoculated with the virus became infected and died at between 2 and 4 days postinoculation (p.i.). High virus titers and viral replication in many tissues were demonstrated at 2 days p.i. in infected birds. The virus from Jalisco, Mexico, had high sequence similarity of greater than 97% to the sequences of wild bird viruses from North America in all eight gene segments. The hemagglutinin gene of the virus contained a 24-nucleotide insert at the hemagglutinin cleavage site which had 100% sequence identity to chicken 28S rRNA, suggesting that the insert was the result of nonhomologous recombination with the host genome. For vaccine protection studies, both U.S. H7 low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and a 2006 Mexican H7 LPAI virus were tested as antigens in experimental oil emulsion vaccines and injected into chickens 3 weeks prior to challenge. All H7 vaccines tested provided ≥90% protection against clinical disease after challenge and decreased the number of birds shedding virus and the titers of virus shed. This study demonstrates the pathological consequences of the infection of chickens with the 2012 Mexican lineage H7N3 HPAI virus and provides support for effective programs of vaccination against this virus in poultry.","2013-08","2017-10-20 09:26:10","2017-10-20 09:26:10","","9086-9096","","16","87","","J Virol","Characterization of the 2012 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H7N3 Virus Isolated from Poultry in an Outbreak in Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23760232 PMCID: PMC3754080","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/8H59XNG3/Kapczynski et al. - 2013 - Characterization of the 2012 Highly Pathogenic Avi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To arrest these declines, it is important to understand the scale of both the problem and the solutions. We analysed an expansive Australian citizen-science dataset, spanning the period 1973 to 2014, to explore factors related to differences in trends among shorebird populations in wetlands throughout Australia. Of seven resident Australian shorebird species, the four inland species exhibited continental decreases, whereas the three coastal species did not. Decreases in inland resident shorebirds were related to changes in availability of water at non-tidal wetlands, suggesting that degradation of wetlands in Australia’s interior is playing a role in these declines. For migratory shorebirds, the analyses revealed continental decreases in abundance in 12 of 19 species, and decreases in 17 of 19 in the southern half of Australia over the past 15 years. Many trends were strongly associated with continental gradients in latitude or longitude, suggesting some large-scale patterns in the decreases, with steeper declines often evident in southern Australia. After accounting for this effect, local variables did not explain variation in migratory shorebird trends between sites. Our results are consistent with other studies indicating that decreases in migratory shorebird populations in the EAAF are most likely being driven primarily by factors outside Australia. This reinforces the need for urgent overseas conservation actions. However, substantially heterogeneous trends within Australia, combined with declines of inland resident shorebirds indicate effective management of Australian shorebird habitat remains important.","2016-05-24","2017-08-10 09:35:36","2017-08-10 09:35:36","2017-08-10 09:35:36","119-135","","2","116","","EMU","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.publish.csiro.au","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/PV63CFI6/MU15056.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poultry and swine production have changed from small-scale methods to industrial-scale operations. There is substantial evidence of pathogen movement between and among these industrial facilities, release to the external environment, and exposure to farm workers, which challenges the assumption that modern poultry production is more biosecure and biocontained as compared with backyard or small holder operations in preventing introduction and release of pathogens. An analysis of data from the Thai government investigation in 2004 indicates that the odds of H5N1 outbreaks and infections were significantly higher in large-scale commercial poultry operations as compared with backyard flocks.

It is well recognised that waterfowl typically show few clinical signs following influenza A infection, in contrast, terrestrial poultry such as chickens may develop severe disease with rapid death following infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza. This study examined the cellular response to influenza infection in primary cells derived from resistant (duck) and susceptible (chicken) avian hosts. Paradoxically, we observed that duck cells underwent rapid cell death following infection with low pathogenic avian H2N3, classical swine H1N1 and 'classical' highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Dying cells showed morphological features of apoptosis, increased DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase 3/7. Following infection of chicken cells, cell death occurred less rapidly, accompanied by reduced DNA fragmentation and caspase activation. Duck cells produced similar levels of viral RNA but less infectious virus, in comparison with chicken cells. Such rapid cell death was not observed in duck cells infected with a contemporary Eurasian lineage H5N1 fatal to ducks. The induction of rapid death in duck cells may be part of a mechanism of host resistance to influenza A, with the loss of this response leading to increased susceptibility to emergent strains of H5N1. These studies provide novel insights that should help resolve the long-standing enigma of host-pathogen relationships for highly pathogenic and zoonotic avian influenza.","2012-01","2017-05-30 14:29:31","2017-05-30 14:29:31","","116-123","","1","90","","Immunol.

However, the emergence of HPAI viruses from low-pathogenic (LPAI) progenitor viruses currently is poorly understood. To investigate the origin and evolution of one of the most important avian influenza epidemics described in Europe, we investigated the evolutionary and spatial dynamics of the entire genome of 109 H7N1 (46 LPAI and 63 HPAI) viruses collected during Italian H7N1 outbreaks between March 1999 and February 2001. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the LPAI and HPAI epidemics shared a single ancestor, that the HPAI strains evolved from the LPAI viruses in the absence of reassortment, and that there was a parallel emergence of mutations among HPAI and later LPAI lineages. Notably, an ultradeep-sequencing analysis demonstrated that some of the amino acid changes characterizing the HPAI virus cluster were already present with low frequency within several individual viral populations from the beginning of the LPAI H7N1 epidemic. A Bayesian phylogeographic analysis revealed stronger spatial structure during the LPAI outbreak, reflecting the more rapid spread of the virus following the emergence of HPAI. The data generated in this study provide the most complete evolutionary and phylogeographic analysis of epidemiologically intertwined high- and low-pathogenicity viruses undertaken to date and highlight the importance of implementing prompt eradication measures against LPAI to prevent the appearance of viruses with fitness advantages and unpredictable pathogenic properties., IMPORTANCE The Italian H7 AI epidemic of 1999 to 2001 was one of the most important AI outbreaks described in Europe. H7 viruses have the ability to evolve into HP forms from LP precursors, although the mechanisms underlying this evolutionary transition are only poorly understood. We combined epidemiological information, whole-genome sequence data, and ultradeep sequencing approaches to provide the most complete characterization of the evolution of HPAI from LPAI viruses undertaken to date. Our analysis revealed that the LPAI viruses were the direct ancestors of the HPAI strains and identified low-frequency minority variants with HPAI mutations that were present in the LPAI samples. Spatial analysis provided key information for the design of effective control strategies for AI at both local and global scales. Overall, this work highlights the importance of implementing rapid eradication measures to prevent the emergence of novel influenza viruses with severe pathogenic properties.","2014-04","2017-05-30 15:54:11","2017-05-30 15:54:11","2017-05-30 15:54:11","4375-4388","","8","88","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24501401 PMCID: PMC3993777","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QBIQUVIU/Monne et al. - 2014 - Emergence of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza V.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3993777/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the free-grazing duck system has been repeatedly highlighted as a major risk factor for HPAI outbreaks. Free-grazing ducks, which scavenge on rice paddies after the harvest, account for a large proportion of the duck population in Vietnam and the wider South-east Asian region. However, the structure and dynamics of the free-grazing duck production from farm to consumption has not been described for Vietnam. In this study, we used a value chain approach to provide a complete picture of the actors involved in the production and marketing of free-grazing duck eggs and spent layer ducks, as well as to investigate the governance structure of this food system. Group interviews and key informant interviews were conducted in two provinces located in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD). The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in farming and trade practices between the two provinces. The trade of spent layer ducks involved large volumes of live ducks being sent to China and Cambodia for consumption, generating a substantial risk of transboundary spread of pathogens, including HPAI viruses. We describe the major role of “duck yards”, which act as hubs in the northbound trade of spent layer ducks. These yards should be considered as essential links in the value chain of spent layer ducks when considering HPAI surveillance and control. The veterinary authorities are only marginally involved in the value chain activities, and their influence could be strengthened by increasing surveillance activities for instance in duck yards. Last, we discuss the dynamics of the duck value chain and further implications for future HPAI management policies.","","2017-09-04 10:38:15","2017-09-04 10:38:15","","n/a-n/a","","","","","Transbound Emerg Dis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/VU97AK2U/Meyer et al. - Trade patterns facilitating highly pathogenic avia.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/5ZFPI89Q/abstract.html","","","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza; Vietnam; free-grazing ducks; poultry trade; value chain analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how bird species are expected to modify their wintering sites in response to climate change, and in turn affect the geographic distribution of the risk associated with H5N1 outbreaks, is unknown. We explored the association between past climate variability and H5N1 outbreaks that were attributed to migratory birds from 2005 to 2009. We then predicted the distribution of risk associated with H5N1 outbreaks based on future climate change scenarios. Overlapping the probabilities of bird distribution and H5N1 outbreaks produced final emergence risk. Our results suggest that minimum daily temperature in the winter (−15 to –11 °C, 15 to 17 °C) and maximum daily temperature in the summer (12 to 15 °C, 30 to 35 °C) governed wild bird migratory routes, while high mean air pressure and low mean specific humidity in the winter impacted the outbreaks of H5N1 among migratory birds. By the end of 2030, Europe may be at higher risk for H5N1 outbreaks in January and February. Northern Africa and Southern and Western Asia will likely be a higher risk for H5N1 outbreaks from April to June. Our findings suggest a potential shift in H5N1 risk from Southeast Asia to the western part of the world due to climate change.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to analyze surface water and groundwater situated up and down gradient from a swine facility for antibiotic-resistant enterococci and other fecal indicators. METHODS: Surface water and groundwater samples (n = 28) were collected up and down gradient from a swine facility from 2002 to 2004. Fecal indicators were isolated by membrane filtration, and enterococci (n = 200) were tested for susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, virginiamycin, and vancomycin. RESULTS: Median concentrations of enterococci, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli were 4- to 33-fold higher in down-gradient versus up-gradient surface water and groundwater. We observed higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for four antibiotics in enterococci isolated from down-gradient versus up-gradient surface water and groundwater. Elevated percentages of erythromycin- (p = 0.02) and tetracycline-resistant (p = 0.06) enterococci were detected in down-gradient surface waters, and higher percentages of tetracycline- (p = 0.07) and clindamycin-resistant (p < 0.001) enterococci were detected in down-gradient groundwater. CONCLUSIONS: We detected elevated levels of fecal indicators and antibiotic-resistant enterococci in water sources situated down gradient from a swine facility compared with up-gradient sources. These findings provide additional evidence that water contaminated with swine manure could contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance.","2007-07","2017-06-01 07:25:18","2017-06-01 07:25:18","","1040-1045","","7","115","","Environ.

Once poultry data were disaggregated into these two production systems, they were analysed in relation to anthropogenic factors using simultaneous autoregressive models. Intensive chicken production was clustered around the capital city of Bangkok and close to the main consumption and export centres. Intensively-raised ducks, mainly free-grazing, showed a distinct pattern with the highest densities distributed in a large area located in the floodplain of the Chao Phraya River. Accessibility to Bangkok, the percentage of irrigated areas and human population density were the most important predictors explaining the geographical distribution of intensively-raised poultry. The distribution of extensive poultry showed a higher predictability.

To test this, we incorporated ecosystem and location of isolation into a comparative genetic analysis. We show high rates of viral transmission from domestic to wild birds within a region and, that wild birds could transmit AIV to poultry between regions. However, the highest rates of viral flow between regions was among domestic populations, indicating poultry trade may play a major role in spreading viral populations. We demonstrate that interactions between migratory birds and animal productions systems contribute to the emergence of AIV. The assumption of unidirectional viral flow from wild birds to domestic poultry provides an incomplete picture of influenza ecology and may confound control efforts.","2016-05-11","2017-03-15 01:50:12","2017-03-15 01:50:12","2017-03-15 01:50:12","e1005620","","5","12","","PLOS Pathogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/6Z4CA5I7/Bahl et al. - 2016 - Ecosystem Interactions Underlie the Spread of Avia.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9BPU9QS2/article.html","","","Ecosystems; Animal Migration; Birds; China; Poultry; Asia; Livestock; Phylogeography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A central question is to determine regions that are likely sources of newly emerging influenza strains with pandemic causing potential. A suitable candidate is Bangladesh, being one of the most densely populated countries in the world and having an intensifying farming system. It is therefore vital to establish the key factors, specific to Bangladesh, that enable both continued transmission within poultry and spillover across the human–animal interface. We apply a modelling framework to H5N1 epidemics in the Dhaka region of Bangladesh, occurring from 2007 onwards, that resulted in large outbreaks in the poultry sector and a limited number of confirmed human cases. This model consisted of separate poultry transmission and zoonotic transmission components. Utilising poultry farm spatial and population information a set of competing nested models of varying complexity were fitted to the observed case data, with parameter inference carried out using Bayesian methodology and goodness-of-fit verified by stochastic simulations. For the poultry transmission component, successfully identifying a model of minimal complexity, which enabled the accurate prediction of the size and spatial distribution of cases in H5N1 outbreaks, was found to be dependent on the administration level being analysed. A consistent outcome of non-optimal reporting of infected premises materialised in each poultry epidemic of interest, though across the outbreaks analysed there were substantial differences in the estimated transmission parameters. The zoonotic transmission component found the main contributor to spillover transmission of H5N1 in Bangladesh was found to differ from one poultry epidemic to another. We conclude by discussing possible explanations for these discrepancies in transmission behaviour between epidemics, such as changes in surveillance sensitivity and biosecurity practices.","2017-02-21","2017-09-06 12:34:32","2017-09-06 12:34:32","","","","","","","Epidemics","Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3H7X5NQ8/Hill et al. - 2017 - Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales.pdf","","","Epidemiology; H5N1; Influenza A; Mathematical modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.","2008-03-25","2017-09-04 10:42:42","2017-09-04 10:42:42","","4769-4774","","12","105","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 18362346 PMCID: PMC2290786","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WJC5EEIV/Gilbert et al. - 2008 - Mapping H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza ris.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","2015-09-23","2017-10-22 08:54:45","2017-10-22 08:54:45","2017-10-22 08:54:45","e0138138","","9","10","","PLOS ONE","Evidence for the Convergence Model","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/8DMEVNQC/Saksena et al. - 2015 - Evidence for the Convergence Model The Emergence .pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/I3KKB3DP/article.html","","","Census; H5N1; Poultry; Vietnam; Livestock; Aquaculture; Delta ecosystems; Rice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decision to use mass vaccination against HPAI in Egypt was taken as an emergency measure based on positive impact of such control measures in Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. However, three years on, the impact on disease control of AI vaccination in Egypt has been very limited. Despite the continuous vaccination of poultry against HPAI, poultry outbreaks and human cases are reported regularly. A recent assessment study highlighted substantial weaknesses in the current immunisation programme and its lack of positive impact on the spread of infection or the maintenance of public health safety. The shortcomings of the vaccination strategy may be attributed in part to a lack of sufficient support in terms of funding and communication, the absence of an efficient monitoring system, and inadequate training of field technicians. The difficulties of blanket vaccinations in semi-commercial farms and household poultry sectors are well known, however, improvements in the industrial sector should be possible though better government controls and greater collaboration with the private sector. AI vaccination should be regarded as just one control tool within a broader disease control program integrating surveillance, outbreak investigation, disease management systems, and the rigorous implementation of bio-security measures. If incorrectly implemented, AI vaccination has a limited impact as a disease control measure. Moreover, without strict bio-security precautions undertaken during its application, farm visits to vaccinate poultry could facilitate the spread of the virus and therefore become a risk factor with important implications on the maintenance of the virus and potential risk for human exposure.","2009-12-09","2017-09-05 05:13:55","2017-09-05 05:13:55","","198-204","","2","3","","J Mol Genet Med","Avian influenza vaccination in Egypt","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20076791 PMCID: PMC2805840","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/D9WIK9KM/Peyre et al. - 2009 - Avian influenza vaccination in Egypt Limitations .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses found that the H5 segment common to the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses readily reassorts with other influenza viruses (see the Perspective by Russell). H5 is thus a continual source of new pathogenic variants. These data also show that the H5N8 virus that recently caused serious outbreaks in European and North American poultry farms came from migrant ducks, swans, and geese that meet at their Arctic breeding grounds. Because the virus is so infectious, culling wild birds is not an effective control measure.

Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses in migratory waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.

Its persistence in a number of countries continues to disrupt poultry production, impairs smallholder livelihoods, and raises the risk a genotype adapted to human-to-human transmission may emerge. While previous studies identified domestic duck reservoirs as a primary risk factor associated with HPAI H5N1 persistence in poultry in Southeast Asia, little is known of such factors in countries with different agro-ecological conditions, and no study has investigated the impact of such conditions on HPAI H5N1 epidemiology at the global scale. This study explores the patterns of HPAI H5N1 persistence worldwide, and for China, Indonesia, and India includes individual provinces that have reported HPAI H5N1 presence during the 2004–2008 period. Multivariate analysis of a set of 14 agricultural, environmental, climatic, and socio-economic factors demonstrates in quantitative terms that a combination of six variables discriminates the areas with human cases and persistence: agricultural population density, duck density, duck by chicken density, chicken density, the product of agricultural population density and chicken output/input ratio, and purchasing power per capita. The analysis identifies five agro-ecological clusters, or niches, representing varying degrees of disease persistence. The agro-ecological distances of all study areas to the medoid of the niche with the greatest number of human cases are used to map HPAI H5N1 risk globally. The results indicate that few countries remain where HPAI H5N1 would likely persist should it be introduced.","2010-06","2017-09-04 10:30:39","2017-09-04 10:30:39","","213-225","","2","7","","Ecohealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20585972 PMCID: PMC3005111","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FSA8AB93/Hogerwerf et al. - 2010 - Persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005111/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand why Gs/GD H5 HPAI viruses infect and transmit more efficiently in waterfowl than other HPAI viruses, groups of mallard ducks were challenged with one of 14 different H5 and H7 HPAI viruses, including a Gs/GD lineage H5N1 (clade 2.2) virus from Mongolia, part of the 2005 dispersion, and the H5N8 and H5N2 index HPAI viruses (clade 2.3.4.4) from the United States, part of the 2014 dispersion. All virus-inoculated ducks and contact exposed ducks became infected and shed moderate to high titers of the viruses, with the exception that mallards were resistant to Ck/Pennsylvania/83 and Ck/Queretaro/95 H5N2 HPAI virus infection. Clinical signs were only observed in ducks challenged with the H5N1 2005 virus, which all died, and with the H5N8 and H5N2 2014 viruses, which had decreased weight gain and fever. These three viruses were also shed in higher titers by the ducks, which could facilitate virus transmission and spread. This study highlights the possible role of wild waterfowl in the spread of HPAI viruses. IMPORTANCE: The spread of H5 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the Gs/GD lineage by migratory waterfowl is a serious concern for animal and public health. H5 and H7 HPAI viruses are considered to be adapted to gallinaceous species (chickens, turkeys, quail, etc.) and less likely to infect and transmit in wild ducks. In order to understand why this is different with certain Gs/GD lineage H5 HPAI viruses, we compared the pathogenicity and transmission of several H5 and H7 HPAI viruses from previous poultry outbreaks to Gs/GD lineage H5 viruses, including H5N1 (clade 2.2), H5N8 and H5N2 (clade 2.3.4.4) viruses, in mallards as a representative wild duck species. Surprisingly, most HPAI viruses examined in this study replicated well and transmitted among mallards; however, the three Gs/GD lineage H5 HPAI viruses replicated to higher titers, which could explain the transmission of these viruses in susceptible wild duck populations.","2016-11-01","2017-03-15 03:01:36","2017-03-15 03:01:36","","9967-9982","","21","90","","J.

S.","Effects of species diversity on disease risk","Ecology Letters","","1461-0248","10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00885.x","","The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.","2006-04","2017-06-04 16:51:15","2017-06-04 16:51:15","","485-498","","4","9","","Ecol.

Noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in China, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds. It is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases. To evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake area, China, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (Region A, B, and C) of Jiangxi Province. We examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices. Region B ranked highest for biosecurity while region C ranked lowest. The risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared. In Region A, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 6.573, 95% CI: 2.148–20.115, P=0.001). In Region B, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.555–10.122, P=0.004). In Region C, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.243–11.255, P=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 3.379, 95% CI: 1.058–10.791, P=0.040). In summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds. The results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural China, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive measures.","2013-06-20","2017-09-04 09:32:36","2017-09-04 09:32:36","2017-09-04 09:32:36","e67366","","6","8","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/Q9U2SMW7/Wang et al. - 2013 - Risk Factors for Infectious Diseases in Backyard P.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/JR66QTM8/article.html","","","Infectious Diseases; Birds; Ducks; Poultry; Livestock; Lakes; Vaccination and immunization; Waterfowl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate whether this mechanism could apply to wild waterfowl, we studied an avirulent wild-swan virus that replicates poorly in chickens. After 24 consecutive passages by air sac inoculation, followed by five passages in chicken brain, the avirulent virus became highly pathogenic in chickens, producing a 100% mortality rate. Sequence analysis at the hemmaglutinin cleavage site of the original isolate revealed a typical avirulence type of sequence, R-E-T-R, which progressed incrementally to a typical virulence type of sequence, R-R-K-K-R, during repeated passages in chickens. These results demonstrate that avirulent viruses maintained in wild waterfowl in nature and bearing the consensus avirulence type sequence R-E-T-R have the potential to become highly pathogenic while circulating in chickens.","2001-05","2017-09-01 13:59:54","2017-09-01 13:59:54","","4439-4443","","9","75","","J Virol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 11287597 PMCID: PMC114193","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HIERVQ99/Ito et al. - 2001 - Generation of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infection with HPAI caused significant morbidity and mortality in chickens, while in ducks the infection was asymptomatic. The HPAI viral mRNA load was higher in all investigated tissues of chickens compared with duck tissues. In the lung, brain and spleen of HPAI-infected chickens, a high, but delayed, pro-inflammatory response of IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA was induced, including up-regulation of IFN-β, IFN-γ, TLR3 and MDA-5 mRNA from 1 day post infection (p.i.). Whereas in ducks already at 8 h p.i., a quicker but lower response was found for IL-6, IL-1β and iNOS mRNA followed by a delayed activation of TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5 and IFN-γ mRNA response. Virus-infected areas in the lung of chickens co-localized with KUL-01⁺ (macrophages, dendritic cells), CD4⁺, and CD8α⁺ cells, during the first day after infection. However, only KUL-01⁺ cells co-localized with the virus after 1 day p.i. In ducks, CVI-ChNL-68.1⁺ (macrophage-like cells), CD4⁺ and CD8α⁺ cells and apoptosis co-localized with the virus within 8 h p.i. Apoptosis was detected in the brain and lung of HPAI-infected chickens after 2 days p.i. and apoptotic cells co-localized with virus-infected areas. In conclusion, excessive delayed cytokine inflammatory responses but inadequate cellular immune responses may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, while ducks initiate a fast lower cytokine response followed by the activation of major pattern recognition receptors (TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5) and a persistent cellular response.","2013-08","2017-05-30 14:17:43","2017-05-30 14:17:43","","347-364","","4","42","","Avian Pathol.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23782222","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782222","","Chickens; Ducks; Influenza in Birds; Male; Poultry Diseases; Species Specificity; Statistics, Nonparametric; Gene Expression Regulation; Brain; DNA Primers; Spleen; Influenza A Virus, H7N1 Subtype; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Viral Load; Apoptosis; Dendritic Cells; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6; Lung; Macrophages; animals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The industrialization of farming has provided parasites with an abundance of hosts and is thought to have influenced parasite evolution. For example, the parasite that causes the highly contagious poultry disease, Marek's disease, has evolved over the past 60 years into a highly virulent pathogen. It is assumed that the industrialization of the industry and vaccination have selected for more virulent strains of the virus. Here, with the use of an impulsive differential equation model, we investigate how modern broiler farm practices could independently lead to virulence evolution. Our model suggests that longer cohort durations and more densely stocked barns both select for less virulent strains of the virus. Our model also suggests that if intensive cleaning between cohorts does not rid the barn of disease, it may drive evolution and cause the disease to become more virulent.","2017-02-01","2017-10-22 15:13:21","2017-10-22 15:13:21","","189-198","","2","10","","Evol Appl","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/8JU8QIQ7/Rozins and Day - 2017 - The industrialization of farming may be driving vi.pdf","","","Poultry; Virulence; Mutation; infectious disease; all-in-all-out; impulsive differential equation; livestock production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, access to high-resolution LUCC products at a global scale for public use is difficult because of data and technical issues. This article presents a Future Land-Use Simulation (FLUS) system to simulate global LUCC in relation to human–environment interactions, which is built and verified by using remote sensing data. IMAGE has been widely used in environmental studies despite its relatively coarse spatial resolution of 30 arc-min, which is about 55 km at the equator. Recently, an improved model has been developed to simulate global LUCC with a 5-min resolution (about 10 km at the equator). We found that even the 10-km resolution, however, still produced major distortions in land-use patterns, leading urban land areas to be underestimated by 19.77 percent at the global scale and global land change relating to urban growth to be underestimated by 60 to 97 percent, compared with the 1-km resolution model proposed through this article. These distortions occurred because a large percentage of small areas of urban land was merged into other land-use classes. During land-use change simulation, a majority of small urban clusters were also lost using the IMAGE product. Responding to these deficiencies, the 1-km FLUS product developed in this study is able to provide the spatial detail necessary to identify spatial heterogeneous land-use patterns at a global scale.

These included 34 ""Asian lineage"" H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (20042006), plus 12 other H5 isolates from poultry outbreaks and wild birds in the Eastern Hemisphere (1996-2005). All 51 were positive by H5 Eurasian RRT-PCR. Specificity was assessed by testing representative isolates from all other AI virus subtypes (n = 52), non-AI avian pathogens (n = 8), plus a negative population of clinical specimens derived from AI-uninfected wild birds and poultry (n = 604); all were negative by H5 Eurasian RRT-PCR. RNA was directly extracted from suspect HPAI H5N1 clinical specimens (Africa, Asia, and Europe; 2005-2006; n - 58) from dead poultry and wild birds, and 55 recorded as positive by H5 Eurasian RRT-PCR: Fifty-one of these 55 were in agreement with positive AIV isolation in embryonated chickens' eggs. H5 Eurasian RRT-PCR was invaluable in H5 outbreak diagnosis and management by virtue of its rapidity and high degree of sensitivity and specificity.

Domestic ducks have been recognized as one of the primary factors in the spread of H5N1 HPAI. In this study we examined the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses in different species and breeds of domestic ducks and the effect of route of virus inoculation on the outcome of infection. We determined that the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses varies between the two common farmed duck species, with Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) presenting more severe disease than various breeds of Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica ducks including Pekin, Mallard-type, Black Runners, Rouen, and Khaki Campbell ducks. We also found that Pekin and Muscovy ducks inoculated with two H5N1 HPAI viruses of different virulence, given by any one of three routes (intranasal, intracloacal, or intraocular), became infected with the viruses. Regardless of the route of inoculation, the outcome of infection was similar for each species but depended on the virulence of the virus used. Muscovy ducks showed more severe clinical signs and higher mortality than the Pekin ducks. In conclusion, domestic ducks are susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus infection by different routes of exposure, but the presentation of the disease varied by virus strain and duck species. This information helps support the planning and implementation of H5N1 HPAI surveillance and control measures in countries with large domestic duck populations.","2013","2017-11-07 10:53:20","2017-11-07 10:53:20","2017-11-07 10:53:20","62","","1","44","","Vet Res","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23876184 PMCID: PMC3733953","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/I2N9TGNE/Pantin-Jackwood et al. - 2013 - Effect of species, breed and route of virus inocul.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733953/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies on the spatial distribution of these vector-borne infections and the main vector species highlighted contrasted eco-climatic regions characterized by different dominant vector species. However, little work was done regarding the factors associated with the velocity of these epidemics. In this study, we aimed to quantify and compare the velocity of BTV epidemic that have affected different European countries under contrasted eco-climatic conditions and to relate these estimates to spatial factors such as temperature and host density. We used the thin plate spline regression interpolation method in combination with trend surface analysis to quantify the local velocity of different epidemics that have affected France (BTV-8 2007–2008, BTV-1 2008–2009), Italy (BTV-1 2014), Andalusia in Spain (BTV-1 2007) and the Balkans (BTV-4 2014). We found significant differences in the local velocity of BTV spread according to the country and epidemics, ranging from 7.9 km/week (BTV-1 2014 Italy) to 24.4 km/week (BTV-1 2008 France).

These new viruses, mostly of subtype H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8 belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, have been found in several Asian countries and have caused outbreaks in poultry in China, South Korea, and Vietnam. HPAI H5Nx also have spread over considerable distances with the introduction of viruses belonging to the same 2.3.4.4 clade in the U.S. (2014-2015) and in Europe (2014-2015 and 2016-2017). In this paper, we examine the emergence and spread of these new viruses in Asia in relation to published datasets on HPAI H5Nx distribution, movement of migratory waterfowl, avian influenza risk models, and land-use change analyses. More specifically, we show that between 2000 and 2015, vast areas of northeast China have been newly planted with rice paddy fields (3.21 million ha in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) in areas connected to other parts of Asia through migratory pathways of wild waterfowl. We hypothesize that recent land use changes in northeast China have affected the spatial distribution of wild waterfowl, their stopover areas, and the wild-domestic interface thereby altering transmission dynamics of avian influenza viruses across flyways. Detailed studies of the habitat use by wild migratory birds, of the extent of the wild-domestic interface, and of the circulation of avian influenza viruses in those new planted areas may help to shed more light on this hypothesis, and on the possible impact of those changes on the long-distance patterns of avian influenza transmission.","2017","2017-12-20 11:55:43","2017-12-20 11:55:43","2017-12-20 11:55:43","","","","4","","Front.

The zoonotic potential and origin of these AIVs immediately became matters of concern. One virus of each subtype H5N1 (150169a), H5N2 (150233) and H5N9 (150236) was characterised. All proved highly pathogenic for poultry as demonstrated molecularly by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in their HA protein – with a sequence (HQRRKR/GLF) previously unknown among avian H5 HPAI viruses – or experimentally by the in vivo demonstration of an intravenous pathogenicity index of 2.9 for the H5N1 HP isolate. Phylogenetic analyses based on the full genomes obtained by NGS confirmed that the eight viral segments of the three isolates were all part of avian Eurasian phylogenetic lineage but differed from the Gs/Gd/1/96-like lineage. The study of the genetic characteristics at specific amino acid positions relevant for modulating the adaptation to and the virulence for mammals showed that presently, these viruses possess most molecular features characteristic of AIV and lack some major characteristics required for efficient respiratory transmission to or between humans. The three isolates are therefore predicted to have no significant pandemic potential.","2017-03-02","2018-01-17 10:07:13","2018-01-17 10:07:13","","","","9","22","","Euro Surveill","Emerging highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses in France during winter 2015/16","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28277218 PMCID: PMC5356430","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MEA7QQ6A/Briand et al. - 2017 - Emerging highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viru.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5356430/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2014, HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have spread rapidly via migratory wild aquatic birds and have evolved through reassortment with prevailing local low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. Group A H5N8 viruses and its reassortant viruses caused outbreaks in wide geographic regions (Asia, Europe, and North America) during 2014–2015. Novel reassortant Group B H5N8 viruses caused outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and Africa during 2016–2017. Novel reassortant Group C H5N6 viruses caused outbreaks in Korea and Japan during the 2016–2017 winter season. Group D H5N6 viruses caused outbreaks in China and Vietnam. A wide range of avian species, including wild and domestic waterfowl, domestic poultry, and even zoo birds, seem to be permissive for infection by and/or transmission of clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses.

The hemagglutinin cleavage site showed that the amino acid sequence motif was identical to that of the Qinghai lineage. For detailed analysis, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of 27 selected Austrian H5N1 viruses originating from different regions and wild bird species were analyzed phylogenetically, which revealed two clearly separated Austrian subclusters, both belonging to European cluster EMA-1. Subcluster South (SCS) contains virus isolates from the south of Austria as well as from Slovenia, Turkey, Egypt, and Nigeria. The second subcluster, Northwest (SCN), covered a larger group of viruses originating from different locations and wild bird species in the northern and very western parts of Austria, as well as from Bavaria and Switzerland. Surprisingly, virus isolates originating from two mute swans and one wild duck found on the north side of the Alps did not cluster with SCN but with SCS. Together with isolates from Bavarian, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Slovakia, they form a genuine subgroup, named subgroup Bavaria (SGB). This subgroup forms a link to SCN, indicating a spread of the virus from south to north. There has been a general assumption that the generic HPAI introduction route into Europe was from Russia to north Germany, introducing cluster EMA-2 into Europe. Interestingly, our findings support the assumption of an alternative introduction of the HPAI H5N1 virus from Turkey to central Europe, where it spread as cluster EMA-1 during the outbreak of 2006.","2010-06-01","2018-01-15 07:01:44","2018-01-15 07:01:44","2018-01-15 07:01:44","5815-5823","","11","84","","J.

Dose–response of the beetle was first examined in a trapping experiment in August 1999. The major pheromone components of I. typographus, (S)-cis-verbenol (cV) and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MB) were released from window traps. Five treatments were replicated five times: (1) blank trap, (2) 0.03 and 1.2, (3) 0.11 and 4.5, (4) 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and (5) Pheroprax. Trap catches increased linearly as a function of increasing release rates of cV and MB. A second study aimed at making preliminary observations on the attraction range of the pheromones as compared to Pheroprax. A release–recapture experiment was carried out in May 2000: four trap-trees located 50 m away from a central release platform were equipped with window traps baited with increasing release rates, tested in separate releases: 0.03 and 1.2; 0.11 and 4.5; 0.34 and 15.2 mg/day of cV and MB, respectively, and Pheroprax. Recaptures increased with the release rate. Trap catches were different at lower release rates, but not between the release rate of 15.2 mg/day of MB and Pheroprax. Variations in captures in relation to wind parameters showed persistently random flight at the lower release rates. Significant upwind flight was observed for Pheroprax only. These results imply that trap interference existed for Pheroprax and suggest that its attraction range may be greater than 50 m.","2001-12-01","2018-01-19 09:43:57","2018-01-19 09:43:57","","2425-2435","","12","27","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In laboratory experiments, adaline was unambiguously detected in fourth instar larvae of H. axyridis having ingested one egg or one first instar larva of Adalia bipunctata. Although prey alkaloids in the predator decreased with time, traces were still detected in pupae, exuviae and imagines of H. axyridis having ingested one prey when they were fourth instar larvae. Analysis of H. axyridis larvae collected in two potato fields shows for the first time in Europe the presence of exogenous alkaloids in 9 out of 28 individuals tested.

In contrast, R. tutela was autogenous and tended to be more fecund under constrained conditions (9.7 vs. 5.1 total offspring per female). The longer pre-oviposition period of the specialist C. bostrichorum, coupled with its greater longevity, afforded the opportunity of better synchronization of ovipositing females with late instar larvae of I. typographus.

Many experiments did not give statistically significant results, due to the low number of true replicates and the spatial heterogeneity of beetle attacks. The protection of horizontal objects like logs or lying trees with anti-attractants was not always successful. In the future, positive results can be expected with an area covering spray applied by zeolite dispensers containing mixtures of verbenone and NHV. A similar approach could probably be used in aerial spraying of anti-attractants. We have succeeded in our attempt to protect zones of standing spruce trees from I. typographus attacks.

Along with seeds, this invading species was accidentally introduced to Europe where it became the major pest in Douglas-fir seed orchards and stands. The high rates of seed parasitism observed in Europe were first ascribed to a reduced control by natural enemies which apparently did not followed M. spermotrophus from their native American range. However, our survey showed that the parasitoid censuses carried out so far were incomplete. Several other chalcid parasitoid species were present in the stands surveyed in Belgium. Four parasitoid species emerged from Douglas-fir seeds infested by the Douglas-fir seed chalcid.

Its monospecific predator Rhizophagus grandis has followed its prey naturally into most areas and since the 1960s has also been mass-produced and released within newly infested locations. Assessing bark-beetle presence at previously uninfested sites, or predator establishment after release or natural spread, currently depends on direct observation of D. micans brood chambers. This is a slow and unreliable process because bark-beetle attacks are solitary, cryptic and occur on living trees. An effective trapping method would thus be most useful. * 2A synthetic lure for R. grandis was first field-tested in release–recapture experiments. Release points were surrounded by one or two concentric rings of traps baited with either D. micans larval frass or with a blend of synthetic chemicals. Kairomone-trapping using the synthetic lure was then tested in the field, monitoring R. grandis in 58 spruce stands in Belgium and France. * 3In the release–recapture experiments, up to 65% of the released predators were caught within 48 h. Catches with the synthetic lure and with prey frass were not significantly different. * 4Field-trapping assays showed R. grandis establishment in 30 stands, including areas where the predator had been introduced artificially. Trapping was unsuccessful at the southern and western limits of D. micans’ range. Combined visual and trapping approaches identified 32 stands containing the predators, with two false negatives with the trapping method, compared to 19 for the visual surveys. * 5Unexpectedly, male and female D. micans adults were trapped in some cases. The combined approach identified 43 attacked stands, among which there were four false negatives with the trapping method and 11 with the visual surveys. * 6Synthesis and applications. To our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of using kairomone traps to monitor a predator after releases for biocontrol. Furthermore, because this predator is strictly prey-specific, this technique also identifies stands colonized by D. micans bark beetles. Following inoculative predator releases, kairomone trapping could be used to survey for D. micans in areas under colonization or in European Union ‘Protected Zones’.","2008-04-01","2018-01-19 09:46:00","2018-01-19 09:46:00","","537-548","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","beetles trapping; biological control; invasive pests monitoring; lures; oxygenated monoterpenes; pheromones; predator–prey relationship; semiochemicals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of zoonoses emerging from livestock, one of the most significant changes that has taken place since the mid twentieth century is what has been termed the “livestock revolution”, whereby the stock of food animals, their productivity and their trade has increased rapidly to feed rising and increasingly wealthy and urbanized populations. Further increases are projected in the future in low and middle-income countries. Using avian influenza as an example, we discuss how the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 in China was linked to rapid intensification of the poultry sector taking place in landscapes rich in wetland agriculture and wild waterfowls habitats, providing an extensive interface with the wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Trade networks and live-poultry markets further exacerbated the spread and persistence of avian influenza as well as human exposure. However, as the history of emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) demonstrates in high-income countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, this is by no way specific to low and middle-income countries. Many HPAI emergence events took place in countries with generally good biosecurity standards, and the majority of these in regions hosting intensive poultry production systems. Emerging zoonoses are only one of a number of externalities of intensive livestock production systems, alongside antimicrobial consumption, disruption of nutrient cycles and greenhouse gases emissions, with direct or indirect impacts on human health. In parallel, livestock production is essential to nutrition and livelihoods in many low-income countries. Deindustrialization of the most intensive production systems in high-income countries and sustainable intensifications in low-income countries may converge to a situation where the nutritional and livelihood benefits of livestock production would be less overshadowed by its negative impacts on human an ecosystem health.","2017-11-27","2018-01-19 10:16:26","2018-04-16 08:49:35","2018-01-19 10:16:26","48","","","75","","Arch Public Health","Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29209498 PMCID: PMC5702979","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/2CBQDDZE/Gilbert et al. - 2017 - Intensifying poultry production systems and the em.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702979/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When a male beetle finds a suitable host, it releases pheromones that attract potential mates as well as other ‘spying’ males, which result in aggregations on the new host. To date, most studies have been concerned with the use of aggregation pheromones by bark beetles to overcome the defences of living, well-protected trees. How insects behave when facing undefended or poorly defended hosts remains largely unknown. The spatio-temporal pattern of resource colonization by the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, was quantified when weakly defended hosts (fallen trees) were attacked. In many of the replicates, colonization began with the insects rapidly scattering over the available surface and then randomly filling the gaps until a regular distribution was established, which resulted in a constant decrease in nearest-neighbour distances to a minimum below which attacks were not initiated. The scattered distribution of the first attacks suggested that the trees were only weakly defended. A minimal theoretical distance of 2.5 cm to the earlier settlers (corresponding to a density of 3.13 attacks dm−2) was calculated, but the attack density always remained lower, between 0.4 and 1.2 holes dm−2, according to our observations.","2018-01-01","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","2018-01-19 13:20:26","170454","","1","5","","","Colonization of weakened trees by mass-attacking bark beetles","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

Here we suggest that, in addition to many other traits, the dorsal spines of its larvae contribute to their success, as suggested by behavioural observations of agonistic interactions between H. axyridis and European coccinellids. In coccinellids, the role of dorsal spines in these interactions has been poorly studied and they could be a physical protection against intraguild predators. Dorsal spines of second instar H. axyridis larvae were removed with micro-scissors, which resulted in spineless larvae after moulting (spineless group). These larvae were then exposed to starved Coccinella septempunctata larvae. Two control categories were also submitted to interactions: H. axyridis larvae with all their spines (control group) and with their spines, but injured by pin stings (injured group). Spine removal at the second instar did not hamper H. axyridis development. The bite rate by C. septempunctata was significantly higher on the spineless H. axyridis and more dorsally located compared to the control and injured groups, while no bite rate difference was observed between the injured and the control group. Our results suggest that in addition to behavioural and chemical defenses, the dorsal spines play a significant protective role against bites. Therefore, spines in ladybirds could be considered as a morphological defense against intraguild predation. In H. axyridis, these defenses might contribute to its success in food resources already exploited by other guild members and thus further facilitate the invasion of new areas.","2017","2018-01-19 13:21:03","2018-01-19 13:21:03","2018-01-19 13:21:03","","","","5","","Front.

The draft method has been tested on pests of concern to the European Union (EU). The method is adaptable and can focus either on all the steps and sub-steps of the assessment process or on specific parts if necessary. It is based on assessing changes in pest population abundance as the major driver of the impact on cultivated plants and on the environment. Like other pest risk assessment systems the method asks questions about the likelihood and magnitude of factors that contribute to risk. Responses can be based on data or expert judgment. Crucially, the approach is quantitative, and it captures uncertainty through the provision by risk assessors of quantile estimates of the probability distributions for the assessed variables and parameters. The assessment is based on comparisons between different scenarios, and the method integrates risk-reducing options where they apply to a scenario, for example current regulation against a scenario where risk-reducing options are not applied. A strategy has been developed to communicate the results of the risk assessment in a clear, comparable and transparent way, with the aim of providing the requestor of the risk assessment with a useful answer to the question(s) posed to the EFSA Plant Health Panel. The method has been applied to four case studies, two fungi, Ceratocystis platani and Cryphonectria parasitica, the nematode Ditylenchus destructor and the Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma.

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. 2.We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. 3.Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographic range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections, and the cost of high resolution data. 4.Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.

In this article we analyzed a livestock mobility database, whose data have been collected by the Centre National d’Elevage et de Recherches Vétérinaires (CNERV) Mauritania, to describe its patterns and temporal evolution. Data were collected through phone and face-to-face interviews in almost all the regions in Mauritania over a period of roughly two weeks during June 2015. The analysis has shown the existence of two mobility patterns throughout the year: the first related to routine movements from January to August; the second strictly connected to the religious festivity of Tabaski that in 2014 occurred at the beginning of October. These mobility patterns are different in terms of animals involved (fewer cattle and dromedaries are traded around Tabaski), the means of transportation (the volume of animals moved by truck raises around Tabaski) and destinations (most of the animals are traded nationally around Tabaski). Due to the differences between these two periods, public health officers, researchers and other stakeholders should take account of the time of the year when implementing vaccination campaigns or creating surveillance networks.","2018-01-24","2018-01-25 14:01:13","2018-01-25 14:01:13","2018-01-25 14:01:13","e0191565","","1","13","","PLOS ONE","Towards the description of livestock mobility in Sahelian Africa","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/JABHSMNM/Apolloni et al. - 2018 - Towards the description of livestock mobility in S.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/U3CRZRDK/article.html","","","Human mobility; Sheep; Transportation; Livestock; Ruminants; Mauritania; Senegal; Infectious disease control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although live bird markets (LBMs) have been implicated in the transmission, dissemination, and circulation of these viruses, an in-depth analysis of the dynamics of avian transmission of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses at the human–animal interface has been lacking. Here we present and evaluate epidemiological findings from active surveillance conducted among poultry in various production sectors in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2016. Overall, the prevalence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in collected samples was 24%. Our data show that AIVs are more prevalent in domestic birds within LBMs (30.4%) than in farms (9.6%). Quail, chickens and ducks showed a high prevalence of AIVs (>20%). The vast majority of AIVs detected (99.7%) have come from apparently healthy birds and poultry drinking water served as a reservoir of AIVs with a prevalence of 32.5% in collected samples. HPAI H5N1 was more frequently detected in ducks while H9N2 was more common in chickens and quail. LBMs, particularly wholesale markets, have become a potential reservoir for various types of AIVs, including HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H9N2. The persistence of AIVs in LBMs is of great concern to public health, and this study highlights the importance of regularly reviewing and implementing infection control procedures as a means of reducing the exposure of the general public to AIVs.","2017-03","2018-01-29 17:29:30","2018-01-29 17:29:30","","e12","","3","6","","Emerg Microbes Infect","Insight into live bird markets of Bangladesh","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28270655 PMCID: PMC5378921","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BAGHIAND/Turner et al. - 2017 - Insight into live bird markets of Bangladesh an o.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5378921/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success.","2003-03-01","2018-02-01 09:26:41","2018-02-01 09:26:41","2018-02-01 09:26:41","471-475","","3","84","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/HZTZBF2G/S0034425702001359.html","","","Remote sensing; MODIS; Vegetation phenology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10–20% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change.","2009-06-01","2018-02-01 09:28:11","2018-02-01 09:28:11","2018-02-01 09:28:11","427-437","","4","12","","Environmental Science & Policy","Croppers to livestock keepers","Special Issue: Food Security and Environmental Change","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/E76S8DF7/S1462901108000944.html","","","Sub-Saharan Africa; Agricultural systems; Poverty; Season failure; Targeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The individual map products include existing global land cover maps such as GlobCover 2005 and MODIS v.5, regional maps such as AFRICOVER and national maps from mapping agencies and other organizations. The different products are ranked at the national level using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood of cropland. Calibration with national and subnational crop statistics was then undertaken to distribute the cropland within each country and subnational unit. The new IIASA-IFPRI cropland product has been validated using very high-resolution satellite imagery via Geo-Wiki and has an overall accuracy of 82.4%. It has also been compared with the EarthStat cropland product and shows a lower root mean square error on an independent data set collected from Geo-Wiki. The first ever global field size map was produced at the same resolution as the IIASA-IFPRI cropland map based on interpolation of field size data collected via a Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing campaign. A validation exercise of the global field size map revealed satisfactory agreement with control data, particularly given the relatively modest size of the field size data set used to create the map. Both are critical inputs to global agricultural monitoring in the frame of GEOGLAM and will serve the global land modelling and integrated assessment community, in particular for improving land use models that require baseline cropland information.

Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

Its causal agent, the pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is vectored primarily by cerambycids of the genus Monochamus Dejean throughout its native (North America) and introduced (Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Portugal) ranges. Despite strict import regulations and phytosanitary measures, interception records indicate that PWN and Monochamus species continue to be moved worldwide. Following its introduction in Portugal in the late 1990s, extensive monitoring programs for PWN and its vectors have been conducted throughout the European Union, using locally developed and tested lures and traps. The trapping system developed in Europe and used in this study is composed of a Crosstrap® and Galloprotect Pack® lures. These trapping systems were deployed in two locations in the USA, two locations in Canada, and one location in China in order to test their capacity to detect Monochamus species exotic to Europe. Large numbers of M. carolinensis, M. mutator, M. notatus, M. s. scutellatus, M. clamator, and M. titillator were trapped in North America, while large numbers of M. alternatus were trapped in China. The trapping systems developed in Europe for monitoring the European Monochamus species are also effective for the detection of many exotic Monochamus species and could thus be used as an early detection tool in ports and other high-risk sites.","2018-02-01","2018-02-08 12:19:42","2018-02-08 12:19:42","","","","","","","Journal of Pest Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of how areas are connected, the strength of these connections and how this translates into disease spread is valuable for planning surveillance and designing control and elimination strategies. While analyses have been undertaken to identify and map connectivity in global air, shipping and migration networks, such analyses have yet to be undertaken on the road networks that carry the vast majority of travellers in low and middle income settings. Here we present methods for identifying road connectivity communities, as well as mapping bridge areas between communities and key linkage routes. We apply these to Africa, and show how many highly-connected communities straddle national borders and when integrating malaria prevalence and population data as an example, the communities change, highlighting regions most strongly connected to areas of high burden. The approaches and results presented provide a flexible tool for supporting the design of disease surveillance and control strategies through mapping areas of high connectivity that form coherent units of intervention and key link routes between communities for targeting surveillance.","2018-02-01","2018-02-02 09:28:34","2018-02-02 09:28:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1802.00301","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SRAG925U/Strano et al. - 2018 - Mapping road network communities for guiding disea.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/JDWM2RZU/1802.html","","","Physics - Physics and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.","2009","2018-02-13 14:24:56","2018-02-13 14:24:56","2018-02-13 14:24:56","677-697","","1","40","","","Species Distribution Models","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/DXLK7MQM/Elith and Leathwick - 2009 - Species Distribution Models Ecological Explanatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a phylogenetic analysis of the largest data set of AIV genomes compiled to date, we were able to document a remarkably high rate of genome reassortment, with no clear pattern of gene segment association and occasional inter-hemisphere gene segment migration and reassortment.

Using direct virus detection, morphological records and comparative analyses, a link was demonstrated between host infection status and host morphologies (the spleen irrespective of weight, the skull shape and the cranial cavity volume) at the level of the individual (females only). This study demonstrates that mammarenavirus infections can impact natural host physiology and/or affect developmental processes. The presence of an infecting micro-parasite during the development of the rat may lead to a physiological trade-off between immunity and brain size.

A central question is to determine regions that are likely sources of newly emerging influenza strains with pandemic causing potential. A suitable candidate is Bangladesh, being one of the most densely populated countries in the world and having an intensifying farming system. It is therefore vital to establish the key factors, specific to Bangladesh, that enable both continued transmission within poultry and spillover across the human-animal interface. We apply a modelling framework to H5N1 epidemics in the Dhaka region of Bangladesh, occurring from 2007 onwards, that resulted in large outbreaks in the poultry sector and a limited number of confirmed human cases. This model consisted of separate poultry transmission and zoonotic transmission components. Utilising poultry farm spatial and population information a set of competing nested models of varying complexity were fitted to the observed case data, with parameter inference carried out using Bayesian methodology and goodness-of-fit verified by stochastic simulations. For the poultry transmission component, successfully identifying a model of minimal complexity, which enabled the accurate prediction of the size and spatial distribution of cases in H5N1 outbreaks, was found to be dependent on the administration level being analysed. A consistent outcome of non-optimal reporting of infected premises materialised in each poultry epidemic of interest, though across the outbreaks analysed there were substantial differences in the estimated transmission parameters. The zoonotic transmission component found the main contributor to spillover transmission of H5N1 in Bangladesh was found to differ from one poultry epidemic to another. We conclude by discussing possible explanations for these discrepancies in transmission behaviour between epidemics, such as changes in surveillance sensitivity and biosecurity practices.","2017-09","2018-04-03 09:09:17","2018-04-03 09:09:17","","37-55","","","20","","Epidemics","Modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh across spatial scales","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28325494","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325494","","Epidemiology; H5N1; Influenza A; Mathematical modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we developed a dynamical species distribution modeling approach forecasting Ae. albopictus eggs abundance at high spatial (0.01 degree WGS84) and temporal (weekly) resolution over 10 Balkan countries, using temperature times series of Modis data products and altitude as input predictors. The model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated over Albania based observed eggs abundance data weekly monitored during three years. For a given week of the year, eggs abundance was mainly predicted by the number of eggs and the mean temperature recorded in the preceding weeks. That is, results are in agreement with the biological cycle of the mosquito, reflecting the effect temperature on eggs spawning, maturation and hatching. The model, seeded by initial egg values derived from a second model, was then used to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of eggs abundance over the selected Balkan countries, weekly in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The present study is a baseline to develop an easy-handling forecasting model able to provide information useful for promoting active surveillance and possibly prevention of Ae. albopictus colonization in presently non-infested areas in the Balkans as well as in other temperate regions.","2018-02-12","2018-04-03 09:11:55","2018-04-03 09:11:55","2018-04-03 09:11:55","e0006236","","2","12","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/NLJLCNQ8/Tisseuil et al. - 2018 - Forecasting the spatial and seasonal dynamic of Ae.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GVVGMAVN/article.pdf","","","Europe; Forecasting; Mosquitoes; Arboviruses; Oviposition; Statistical distributions; Statistical models; Theoretical ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that within each wild fowl migratory flyway, the timing of H5N1 outbreaks and viral migrations are closely associated, but little viral transmission was observed between the flyways. The bird migration network is shown to better reflect the observed viral gene sequence data than other networks and contributes to seasonal H5N1 epidemics in local regions and its large-scale transmission along flyways.

We investigated and summarized the literature on emerging HPAI H5 and H7 viruses with the aim of building a spatio-temporal database of all these recorded conversions and reassortments events. We subsequently mapped the spatio-temporal distribution of known emergence events, as well as the species and production systems that they were associated with, the aim being to establish their main characteristics. From 1959 onwards, we identiﬁed a total of 39 independent H7 and H5 LPAI to HPAI conversion events. All but two of these events were reported in commercial poultry production systems, and a majority of these events took place in high-income countries. In contrast, a total of 127 reassortments have been reported from 1983 to 2015, which predominantly took place in countries with poultry production systems transitioning from backyard to intensive production systems. Those systems are characterized by several co-circulating viruses, multiple host species, regular contact points in live bird markets, limited biosecurity within value chains, and frequent vaccination campaigns that impose selection pressures for emergence of novel reassortants. We conclude that novel HPAI emergences by these two mechanisms occur in different ecological niches, with different viral, environmental and host associated factors, which has implications in early detection and management and mitigation of the risk of emergence of novel HPAI viruses.","2018-06-05","2018-06-22 08:59:30","2018-06-22 08:59:31","2018-06-22 08:59:30","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QSBTD2K2/Dhingra et al. - 2018 - Geographical and Historical Patterns in the Emerge.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters of HPAI A (H5N1) virus emerged, leading to an important number of AI A (H5N1) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date, few studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A (H5N1) outbreaks in Egypt in relation to protective / risk factors at the farm level, a gap we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production, as a basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A (H5N1) presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta. Results: The probability of HPAI A (H5N1) presence was associated with several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status, absence of windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of production were found to be protective factors, whereas the presence of a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the village was found to be a risk factor. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A (H5N1) virus circulation, which could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt.","2018-12","2018-06-22 08:59:28","2018-06-22 08:59:29","2018-06-22 08:59:28","","","1","14","","","Avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks in different poultry farm types in Egypt","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MZXH52US/Artois et al. - 2018 - Avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks in different po.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth&rsquo;s surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.","2018-07-20","2018-07-20 07:50:24","2018-07-20 07:50:24","2018-07-20 07:50:24","1145","","7","10","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MF7GBYZV/Forget et al. - 2018 - Supervised Classification of Built-Up Areas in Sub.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/CVPNUWZB/1145.html","","","built-up detection; landsat; openstreetmap; urban remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.","2018-07-18","2018-07-20 08:01:40","2018-07-20 08:01:40","2018-07-20 08:01:40","e0199547","","7","13","","PLOS ONE","Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in Mauritania","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WS8BDPIW/Nicolas et al. - 2018 - Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/RGKMM87W/article.html","","","Cattle; Sheep; Livestock; Ruminants; Camels; Mauritania; Veterinary diseases; Centrality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge gaps in the geographic distribution and environmental determinants of farming systems, especially if viewed through the livestock lens, compound this problem. We have produced a map of pastoral, agro-pastoral and mixed farming systems across Eastern Africa, by analysing datasets collected in the framework of livelihood analysis. Input data were gathered between 2000 and 2007 by various emergency and development agencies for Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and parts of Ethiopia and Sudan. A quantitative definition of the production systems is adopted, based on the ratio of livestock- to crop-derived income. The resulting livelihood-based map of livestock production systems was compared through correspondence analysis to an alternative livestock production systems map, produced independently from environmental data. Convergence between the two mapping approaches was evident. The geographic distribution of the livestock production systems was also modelled using multivariate analysis of remotely sensed and other geospatial datasets. Models show high statistical accuracy, and were thus used to fill the gaps in the observed distribution of livestock production systems. Finally, selected environmental factors underpinning the systems (agro-climatology, human and livestock populations and land cover) were analysed in detail, enabling the livestock production systems to be characterized in terms of them. The regional scope of the map, as well as its direct link with a vast amount of livelihood information, render it a valuable tool for a range of development and research applications, including those related to global change.","2010-01-01","2018-08-07 08:11:08","2018-08-07 08:11:08","2018-08-07 08:11:08","98-110","","1","135","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/I99SKGT4/S016788090900262X.html","","","Livestock; Mapping; GIS; Eastern Africa; Farming systems; Livelihood analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Domestic and wild vertebrates are asymptomatic reservoirs for the virus, putting animal handlers, slaughter-house workers and agricultural labourers at highest risk in endemic areas, with secondary transmission possible through contact with infected blood and other bodily fluids. Human infection is characterized by severe symptoms that often result in death. While it is known that CCHFV transmission is limited to Africa, Asia and Europe, definitive global extents and risk patterns within these limits have not been well described. Methods We used an exhaustive database of human CCHF occurrence records and a niche modeling framework to map the global distribution of risk for human CCHF occurrence. Results A greater proportion of shrub or grass land cover was the most important contributor to our model, which predicts highest levels of risk around the Black Sea, Turkey, and some parts of central Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa shows more focalized areas of risk throughout the Sahel and the Cape region. Conclusions These new risk maps provide a valuable starting point for understanding the zoonotic niche of CCHF, its extent and the risk it poses to humans.","2015-08","2018-10-05 06:39:49","2018-10-05 06:39:49","2018-10-05 06:39:49","503-513","","8","109","","Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26142451 PMCID: PMC4501401","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/Y7AYPWW3/Messina et al. - 2015 - The global distribution of Crimean-Congo hemorrhag.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501401/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study integrated parasitological and ancient DNA methods with a large sample set dating between Neolithic and Early Modern periods to explore the utility of molecular archaeoparasitology as a new approach to study the past. Molecular analyses provided unequivocal species-level parasite identification and revealed location-specific epidemiological signatures. Faecal–oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were ubiquitous across time and space. By contrast, high numbers of food-associated cestodes (Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata) were restricted to medieval Lübeck. The presence of these cestodes and changes in their prevalence at approximately 1300 CE indicate substantial alterations in diet or parasite availability. Trichuris trichiura ITS-1 sequences grouped into two clades; one ubiquitous and one restricted to medieval Lübeck and Bristol. The high sequence diversity of T.t.ITS-1 detected in Lübeck is consistent with its importance as a Hanseatic trading centre. Collectively, these results introduce molecular archaeoparasitology as an artefact-independent source of historical evidence.","2018","2018-10-06 18:36:13","2018-10-06 18:36:13","","","","1888","285","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes tools to measure spatial autocorrelation ranges in candidate covariates, providing the user with insights into the spatial structure in these data. It also offers interactive graphical capabilities for creating spatial blocks and exploring data folds. 4.Package BLOCKCV enables modellers to more easily implement a range of evaluation approaches. It will help the modelling community learn more about the impacts of evaluation approaches on our understanding of predictive performance of species distribution models.

However, few tools exist to evaluate the impact of decentralisation on patient travel time or what proportion of patients attend their nearest clinic. Here we develop methods to monitor changes in travel time, using data from the antiretroviral therapy (ART) roll-out in a rural district in North Malawi. METHODS: Clinic position was combined with GPS information on the home village of patients accessing ART services in Karonga District (North Malawi) between July 2005 and July 2009. Potential travel time was estimated as the travel time for an individual attending their nearest clinic, and estimated actual travel time as the time to the clinic attended. This allowed us to calculate changes in potential and actual travel time as new clinics opened and track the proportion and origin of patients not accessing their nearest clinic. RESULTS: The model showed how the opening of further ART clinics in Karonga District reduced median potential travel time from 83 to 43 minutes, and median actual travel time fell from 83 to 47 minutes. The proportion of patients not attending their nearest clinic increased from 6% when two clinics were open, to 12% with four open. DISCUSSION: Integrating GPS information with patient data shows the impact of decentralisation on travel time and clinic choice to inform policy and research questions. In our case study, travel time decreased, accompanied by an increased uptake of services. However, the model also identified an increasing proportion of ART patients did not attend their nearest clinic.","2012-11-15","2018-10-24 11:25:53","2018-10-24 11:25:53","","49","","","11","","Int J Health Geogr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23153311 PMCID: PMC3517381","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4HPT7YNN/Houben et al. - 2012 - Monitoring the impact of decentralised chronic car.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153311","","Humans; Time Factors; Travel; Politics; Malawi; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Chronic Disease; Geographic Mapping; Health Services Accessibility; Rural Health Services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of ‘leaving no one behind’ established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations1. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago2, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.","2018-01","2018-10-24 11:33:09","2018-10-24 11:33:16","2018-10-24 11:33:09","333-336","","7688","553","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GNXSVV72/Weiss et al. - 2018 - A global map of travel time to cities to assess in.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/2SLMC62L/nature25181.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Food and Agriculture Organization views vaccination as a legitimate aid in the control and prevention of infection and disease caused by HPAI viruses but does not see it as a panacea. Vaccination should be used as just one in a number of measures used together to reduce the effect and risk of infection. It will be required for a considerable time in endemically infected countries. The methods used in Vietnam in implementing blanket vaccination against H5N1 HPAI viruses demonstrate the steps that should be considered when introducing vaccination. So far, it has not been possible to determine the precise effect of vaccination in endemically infected countries because it has been used in combination with other measures. Well managed vaccination campaigns will reduce the incidence of infection in poultry and therefore reduce the risk to humans from these viruses.

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.","2018-09-13","2018-10-10 09:27:23","2018-10-10 09:27:23","2018-10-10 09:27:23","e1006439","","9","14","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7A5UVWGK/Hill et al. - 2018 - The impact of surveillance and control on highly p.pdf","","","Bangladesh; Epidemiology; H5N1; Poultry; Livestock; Infectious disease control; Infectious disease surveillance; Vaccination and immunization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild birds have traditionally not been involved in its spread, but the epidemiology of HPAI has changed in recent years. After its emergence in southeastern Asia in 1996, H5 HPAI virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage has evolved into several sub-lineages, some of which have spread over thousands of kilometers via long-distance migration of wild waterbirds. In order to determine whether the virus is adapting to wild waterbirds, we experimentally inoculated the HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A from 2014 into four key waterbird species—Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), common teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and common pochard (Aythya ferina)—and compared virus excretion and disease severity with historical data of the HPAI H5N1 virus infection from 2005 in the same four species. Our results showed that excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons for the 2014 virus, whereas excretion was highest in common pochards and mallards for the 2005 virus. The 2014 virus infection was subclinical in all four waterbird species, while the 2005 virus caused clinical disease and pathological changes in over 50% of the common pochards. In chickens, the 2014 virus infection caused systemic disease and high mortality, similar to the 2005 virus. In conclusion, the evidence was strongest for Eurasian wigeons as long-distance vectors for HPAI H5N8 virus from 2014. The implications of the switch in species-specific virus excretion and decreased disease severity may be that the HPAI H5 virus more easily spreads in the wild-waterbird population.","2018-04-18","2018-09-13 05:18:19","2018-09-13 05:18:19","2018-09-13 05:18:19","67","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surveillance of H5N1 viruses in live bird markets (LBMs) during 2012 and 2013 was carried out to provide epidemiologic and virologic information regarding viral circulation and the risk of human exposure. Real-time RT-PCR of avian cloacal swabs and environmental samples revealed influenza A-positive specimens, which were then subjected to virus isolation and genomic sequencing. Genetic analysis of specimens collected at multiple LBMs in Indonesia identified both low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H3N8) and HPAI A(H5N1) viruses belonging to clade 2.1.3.2a. Comparison of internal gene segments among the LPAI and HPAI viruses revealed that the latter had acquired the PB2, PB1, and NS genes from LPAI progenitors and other viruses containing a wild type (wt) genomic constellation. Comparison of murine infectivity of the LPAI A(H3N8), wt HPAI A(H5N1) and reassortant HPAI A(H5N1) viruses showed that the acquisition of LPAI internal genes attenuated the reassortant HPAI virus, producing a mouse infectivity/virulence phenotype comparable to that of the LPAI virus. Comparison of molecular markers in each viral gene segment suggested that mutations in PB2 and NS1 may facilitate attenuation. The discovery of an attenuated HPAI A(H5N1) virus in mice that resulted from reassortment may have implications for the capability of these viruses to transmit and cause disease. In addition, surveillance suggests that LBMs in Indonesia may play a role in the generation of reassortant A(H5) viruses and should be monitored.","2018-08-22","2018-09-13 05:14:40","2018-09-13 05:14:40","2018-09-13 05:14:40","147","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many subtypes of avian influenza viruses are circulating in aquatic birds. Most avian influenza viruses found in aquatic birds are low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been found in waterfowls since 2005. It is known that H5 and H7 subtypes of avian influenza viruses can be mutated into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry. In this study, we isolated novel reassortant H7N7 avian influenza virus from the fecal materials of migratory birds in the Western part of South Korea in 2016, and analyzed the sequences of all its eight genes. The genetic analysis of our isolate, A/waterfowl/Korea/S017/2016 (H7N7) indicates that it was reassortant avian influenza virus containing genes of both avian influenza viruses of wild birds and domestic ducks. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolate belongs to Eurasian lineage of avian influenza virus.

Poultry is accepted as a good source of protein and the poultry industry will be forced to intensify production in many countries, leading to greater numbers of farms that house birds at elevated densities. Increasing farmed poultry can facilitate enhanced transmission of infectious pathogens among birds, such as avian influenza virus among others, which have the potential to induce widespread mortality in poultry and cause considerable economic losses. Additionally, the capability of some emerging poultry pathogens to cause zoonotic human infection will be increased as greater numbers of poultry operations could increase human contact with poultry pathogens. In order to combat the increased risk of spread of infectious disease in poultry due to intensified systems of production, rapid detection and diagnosis is paramount. In this review, multiple technologies that can facilitate accurate and rapid detection and diagnosis of poultry diseases are highlighted from the literature, with a focus on technologies developed specifically for avian influenza virus diagnosis. Rapid detection and diagnostic technologies allow for responses to be made sooner when disease is detected, decreasing further bird transmission and associated costs. Additionally, systems of rapid disease detection produce data that can be utilized in decision support systems that can predict when and where disease is likely to emerge in poultry. Other sources of data can be included in predictive models, and in this review two highly relevant sources, internet based-data and environmental data, are discussed. Additionally, big data and big data analytics, which will be required in order to integrate voluminous and variable data into predictive models that function in near real-time are also highlighted. Implementing new technologies in the commercial setting will be faced with many challenges, as will designing and operating predictive models for poultry disease emergence. The associated challenges are summarized in this review. Intensified systems of poultry production will require new technologies for detection and diagnosis of infectious disease. This review sets out to summarize them, while providing advantages and limitations of different types of technologies being researched.","2018","2018-10-31 02:29:38","2018-10-31 02:29:38","2018-10-31 02:29:38","","","","5","","Front.

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.","2017-10-11","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2018-11-07 13:34:07","2018-11-07 13:34:07","20170919","","1864","284","","Proc.

In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.","2018-10-30","2018-11-27 15:31:03","2018-11-27 15:31:03","2018-11-27 15:31:03","180227","","","5","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SHZ6W3X2/Gilbert et al. - 2018 - Global distribution data for cattle, buffaloes, ho.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/WMCNPAXR/sdata2018227.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple peculiar mutations were characterized in the Egyptian H5N8 viruses, which probably permits transmission and virulence of these viruses in mammals.

Also, the Egyptian H5N8 viruses were fully sensitive to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors.

LPAI suitability maps were based on wild bird demographics, LPAI surveillance, and poultry density in combination with environmental, climatic, and socio-economic risk factors. Species distribution modeling was used to produce high-resolution (cell size: 500m x 500m) maps for Avian Influenza (AI) suitability in each of the four North American migratory flyways (NAMF). Results reveal that AI suitability is heterogeneously distributed throughout the US with higher suitability in specific zones of the Midwest and coastal areas. The resultant suitability maps adequately predicted most of the HPAI outbreak areas during the 2014–2015 epidemic in the US (i.e. 89% of HPAI outbreaks were located in areas identified as highly suitable for LPAI). Results are potentially useful for poultry producers and stakeholders in designing risk-based surveillance, outreach and intervention strategies to better prevent and control future HPAI outbreaks in the US.","2016-09-14","2018-12-17 06:00:36","2018-12-17 06:00:36","2018-12-17 06:00:36","33161","","","6","","","","","","","","","","en","2016 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/I2KXH9PA/Belkhiria et al. - 2016 - Application of Species Distribution Modeling for A.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KX3CTWST/srep33161.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our modelling included a consideration of the multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation of environmental variables and an examination of the reproducibility of the model results. Location Japan. Methods We used the maximum entropy approach to generate potential distribution models from presence-only data. Independent variables in the model included environmental factors such as winter temperature and precipitation, host factors such as duck population size and habitat abundance and artificial factors such as size of urban areas and poultry density. We used eigenvector-based spatial filters to alleviate spatial autocorrelation. To explore the reliability of the model, we compared the risk indices of localities positive in past winters for the influenza A virus in wild birds with those of all localities. Results The model alleviated spatial autocorrelation with a high degree of accuracy. Dabbling duck population, size of urban area, diving duck population and altitude were the variables that were most strongly correlated with the potential distribution of avian influenza. We used the frequency of occurrence of the influenza A virus in five recent years in localities where wild birds were infected to estimate the repeatability of the high-risk indices; the potential risk indices for avian influenza in wild birds were high in localities where wild birds were infected in past. Main conclusions The dabbling duck population in an area appeared to be the best indicator of high risk for the introduction of avian influenza from abroad. Priority monitoring localities for avian influenza carried by wild birds should be designated in western Japan and along the Pacific coast, which we estimated to be high-risk areas. Poultry farms in these areas should increase their biosecurity to prevent vectors from introducing avian influenza.","2013","2018-12-17 06:02:24","2018-12-17 06:02:24","2018-12-17 06:02:24","78-85","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/PL3XD67C/ddi.html","","","avian flu; eigenvector-based spatial filtering; HPAI-H5N1; MaxEnt; species distribution model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new H17N10 subtype in Central American fruit bats suggests that other New World species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses. Using consensus degenerate RT-PCR, we identified a novel influenza A virus, designated as H18N11, in a flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru. Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses.","2013","2019-01-04 06:31:49","2019-01-04 06:31:49","","e1003657","","10","9","","PLoS Pathog.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24130481 PMCID: PMC3794996","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4NMVNPX2/Tong et al. - 2013 - New world bats harbor diverse influenza A viruses.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130481","","Animals; Disease Reservoirs; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza A virus; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Phylogeny; Peru; Chiroptera","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most evidence still supports this dogma, recent studies in bats have suggested other reservoir species may also exist. Extensive surveillance studies coupled with an enhanced awareness in response to H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 outbreaks is also revealing a growing list of animals susceptible to infection with influenza A viruses. Although in a relatively stable host-pathogen interaction in aquatic birds, antigenic, and genetic evolution of influenza A viruses often accompanies interspecies transmission as the virus adapts to a new host. The evolutionary changes in the new hosts result from a number of processes including mutation, reassortment, and recombination. Depending on host and virus these changes can be accompanied by disease outbreaks impacting wildlife, veterinary, and public health.","2014","2019-01-04 06:19:27","2019-01-04 06:20:20","","359-375","","","385","","Curr.

Based on spatial, temporal and phylogenetic analyses of data generated as part of intense and large-scale influenza surveillance programs in wild birds and poultry in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2011, we demonstrate that LPAIV subtype distribution differed between wild birds and poultry, suggestive of host-range restrictions. LPAIV isolated from Dutch poultry were genetically most closely related to LPAIV isolated from wild birds in the Netherlands or occasionally elsewhere in Western Europe. However, a relatively long time interval was observed between the isolations of related viruses from wild birds and poultry. Spatial analyses provided evidence for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) being more abundant near primary infected poultry farms.

Influenza A viruses are unique in many ways. Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect. This includes waterfowl (the original reservoir), terrestrial and aquatic poultry, swine, humans, horses, dog, cats, whales, seals and several other mammalian species. Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species. Finally, they are unique in the frequency of inter-species transmission events that occur. Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza virus strain in an immunologically naïve population can be devastating. The problems that influenza A viruses present for human and animal health are numerous. For example, influenza A viruses in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

However, such models are not equally reliable for all species, and range size can affect their performance. We examined to what extent this effect reflects statistical artefacts arising from the influence of range size on the sample size and sampling prevalence (proportion of samples representing species presence) of data used to train and test models. 2 Our analyses used both simulated data and empirical distribution models for 32 bird species endemic to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Models were built with either logistic regression or non-linear discriminant analysis, and assessed with four measures of model accuracy: sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Environmental indices derived from Fourier-processed satellite imagery served as predictors. 3 We first followed conventional modelling practice to illustrate how range size might influence model performance, when sampling prevalence reflects species’ natural prevalences. We then demonstrated that this influence is primarily artefactual. Statistical artefacts can arise during model assessment, because Cohen's kappa responds systematically to changes in prevalence. AUC, in contrast, is largely unaffected, and thus a more reliable measure of model performance. Statistical artefacts also arise during model fitting. Both logistic regression and discriminant analysis are sensitive to the sample size and sampling prevalence of training data. Both perform best when sample size is large and prevalence intermediate. 4 Synthesis and applications. Species’ ecological characteristics may influence the performance of distribution models. Statistical artefacts, however, can confound results in comparative studies seeking to identify these characteristics. To mitigate artefactual effects, we recommend careful reporting of sampling prevalence, AUC as the measure of accuracy, and fixed, intermediate levels of sampling prevalence in comparative studies.","2004","2019-01-03 07:16:57","2019-01-03 07:16:57","2019-01-03 07:16:57","811-823","","5","41","","","The effects of species’ range sizes on the accuracy of distribution models","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KB5ZMWVB/McPHERSON et al. - 2004 - The effects of species’ range sizes on the accurac.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZB5W9K2E/j.0021-8901.2004.00943.html","","","logistic regression; satellite imagery; discriminant analysis; kappa; prevalence; ROC plots; sample size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we develop a set of mathematical models that simulate the spread of HPAI H5N1 in the poultry industry in Thailand, utilising data from the 2004 epidemic. The model that incorporates the intensity of duck farming when assessing transmision risk provides the best fit to the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed outbreak, implying that intensive duck farming drives transmission of HPAI in Thailand. We also extend our models using a sequential model fitting approach to explore the ability of the models to be used in ""real time"" during novel disease outbreaks.

In early June 2017, Zimbabwe reported an outbreak of the virus in commercial breeder chickens near Harare, and on the 19th of June 2017 the first case of HPAI H5N8 was confirmed in a broiler breeder operation near Villiers, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, representing the first ever notifiable influenza in gallinaceous poultry in South Africa. Forty viruses were isolated from wild birds, backyard hobby fowl, zoo collections, commercial chickens and commercial ostriches over the course of the outbreak and full genomes were sequenced and compared, to determine the epidemiologic events in the introduction and spread of Clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 across the country.

Two distinct variants, suggesting independent introductions, were responsible for the first two index cases and were not directly related to the virus involved in Zimbabwe outbreak.

Wild birds have traditionally not been involved in its spread, but the epidemiology of HPAI has changed in recent years. After its emergence in southeastern Asia in 1996, H5 HPAI virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage has evolved into several sub-lineages, some of which have spread over thousands of kilometers via long-distance migration of wild waterbirds. In order to determine whether the virus is adapting to wild waterbirds, we experimentally inoculated the HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A from 2014 into four key waterbird species—Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), common teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and common pochard (Aythya ferina)—and compared virus excretion and disease severity with historical data of the HPAI H5N1 virus infection from 2005 in the same four species. Our results showed that excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons for the 2014 virus, whereas excretion was highest in common pochards and mallards for the 2005 virus. The 2014 virus infection was subclinical in all four waterbird species, while the 2005 virus caused clinical disease and pathological changes in over 50% of the common pochards. In chickens, the 2014 virus infection caused systemic disease and high mortality, similar to the 2005 virus. In conclusion, the evidence was strongest for Eurasian wigeons as long-distance vectors for HPAI H5N8 virus from 2014. The implications of the switch in species-specific virus excretion and decreased disease severity may be that the HPAI H5 virus more easily spreads in the wild-waterbird population.","2018-04-18","2018-12-31 06:57:58","2018-12-31 06:57:58","2018-12-31 06:57:58","67","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","En","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/TVIZSYSR/Brand et al. - 2018 - Wild ducks excrete highly pathogenic avian influen.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/BPKQPR9V/s41426-018-0070-9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A retrospective survey carried out towards the end of 2007, coupled with follow-up spatial analysis, support the notion that the H5N1 virus may have spread from rural areas of northern Nigeria near wetlands frequented by palaearctic migratory birds. Possibly, this could have happened already during November to December 2005, one or two months prior to the first officially reported outbreak in a commercial poultry farm (Kaduna state). It is plausible that backyard poultry played a more important role in the H5N1 propagation than thought previously. Farming landscapes with significant numbers of domestic ducks may have helped to bridge the geographical and ecological gap between the waterfowl in the wetlands and the densely populated poultry rich states in north-central Nigeria, where the virus had more sizeable, visible impact.","2008-11","2018-12-28 04:58:04","2018-12-28 04:58:04","","7-16","","1","3","","Geospat Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 19021104","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4JLGL9Y7/Cecchi et al. - 2008 - Agro-ecological features of the introduction and s.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19021104","","Animal Husbandry; Animal Migration; Animals; Animals, Wild; Birds; Chickens; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Demography; Disease Outbreaks; Ducks; Ecology; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Poultry; Poultry Diseases; Seasons; Retrospective Studies; Nigeria; Rain; Public Health Informatics; Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both models had good accuracy (test AUC > 0.8 and True Skill Statistic > 0.4), and high overlap between suitability scores (I statistic 0.786) and suitable habitat patches (relative rank 0.639). Our results suggest that, at the state-wide level, eBird occurrence data can effectively model similar species distributions as satellite tracking data. Climate change models for the band-tailed pigeon predict a 35% loss in area of suitable climate by 2070 if CO2 emissions drop to 1990 levels by 2100, and a 45% loss by 2070 if we continue current CO2 emission levels through the end of the century.

This information, however, is rarely considered in influenza risk models, partly due to a lack of data. We aim to identify areas of high transmission risk between domestic poultry and wild waterfowl in China, the epicenter of both viruses. Two levels of models were developed: one that predicts hotspots of novel virus emergence between domestic and wild birds, and one that incorporates H5N1 risk factors, for which input data exists. Models were produced at 1 km and 30 km spatial resolution, and two temporal seasons. Patterns of risk varied between seasons with higher risk in the northeast, central-east, and western regions of China during spring and summer, and in the central and southeastern regions during winter. Monte-Carlo uncertainty analyses indicated varying levels of model confidence, with lowest errors in the densely populated regions of eastern and southern China.

For KDE, we considered 4 bandwidth selectors: the reference bandwidth, least-squares cross-validation (LSCV), direct plug-in (DPI), and solve-the-equation (STE). For the sample sizes and UD patterns tested here, KDE achieved significantly higher volume-of-intersection (VI) scores with known parent UDs than did LCH; KDE also provided less biased home-range area estimates under many conditions. However, LCH minimized the UD volume that occurred outside the true home range boundary (Vout). Among the KDE bandwidth estimators, relative performance depended on the type and intensity of space use patterns, sample size, and the metric used to evaluate performance.

This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.","2014","2019-01-07 09:04:56","2019-01-07 09:04:56","","4","","1","2","","Mov Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25520815 PMCID: PMC4267544","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4V7P5C5I/Thurfjell et al. - 2014 - Applications of step-selection functions in ecolog.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25520815","","Remote sensing; Broken stick model; Geographic Information System GIS; GPS telemetry; Habitat selection; Individual modelling; Resource Selection Function RSF; Resource Selection Probability Function RSPF; State-space model; Step Selection Function SSF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Behavioral strategies like migration, hibernation, and a life cycle adapted to the local seasonality help to cope with fluctuations in environmental conditions. Thus, how an individual utilizes the environment depends both on the current availability of habitat and the behavioral prerequisites of the individual at that time. While the increasing availability and richness of animal movement data has facilitated the development of algorithms that classify behavior by movement geometry, changes in the environmental correlates of animal movement have so far not been exploited for a behavioral annotation. Here, we suggest a method that uses these changes in individual–environment associations to divide animal location data into segments of higher ecological coherence, which we term niche segmentation. We use time series of random forest models to evaluate the transferability of habitat use over time to cluster observational data accordingly. We show that our method is able to identify relevant changes in habitat use corresponding to both changes in the availability of habitat and how it was used using simulated data, and apply our method to a tracking data set of common teal (Anas crecca). The niche segmentation proved to be robust, and segmented habitat suitability outperformed models neglecting the temporal dynamics of habitat use. Overall, we show that it is possible to classify animal trajectories based on changes of habitat use similar to geometric segmentation algorithms. We conclude that such an environmentally informed classification of animal trajectories can provide new insights into an individuals' behavior and enables us to make sensible predictions of how suitable areas might be connected by movement in space and time.","2016","2019-01-07 09:06:24","2019-01-07 09:06:24","2019-01-07 09:06:24","e01498","","10","7","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 van Toor et al.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XBPY7CHB/Toor et al. - 2016 - Temporal segmentation of animal trajectories infor.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/N9A4PR9I/ecs2.html","","","migration; species distribution model; life history; Anas crecca; animal movement; common teal; habitat use; niche dynamics; random forest models; segmentation; simulation; transferability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the example of bar-headed geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level throughout the annual cycle in their native range.MethodsWe used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability within the species’ range. We simulated migratory movements between range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.ResultsSimulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating previous findings for this species.ConclusionsWe show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year and even outside the spatial range of the available data.

Previous studies have shed light on the factors influencing bird migration but have mainly relied on statistical correlative analysis of tracking data. Our novel method offers a bottom up explanation of population-level migratory movement patterns. It differs from previous mechanistic models of animal migration and enables predictions of pathways and destinations from a given starting location. We define an environmental potential landscape from environmental data and simulate bird movement within this landscape based on simple decision rules drawn from statistical mechanics. We explore the capacity of the model by qualitatively comparing simulation results to the non-breeding migration patterns of a seabird species, the Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophris). This minimal, two-parameter model was able to capture remarkably well the previously documented migration patterns of the Black-browed Albatross, with the best combination of parameter values conserved across multiple geographically separate populations. Our physics-inspired mechanistic model could be applied to other bird and highly-mobile species, improving our understanding of the relative importance of various factors driving migration and making predictions that could be useful for conservation.","2017-08-29","2019-01-07 09:08:45","2019-01-07 09:08:45","2019-01-07 09:08:45","9870","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/7IKAZ8BD/Revell and Somveille - 2017 - A Physics-Inspired Mechanistic Model of Migratory .pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/5QGFTCVZ/s41598-017-09270-6.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as “feature types” in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.","2013-02-14","2019-01-07 09:27:23","2019-01-07 09:27:23","2019-01-07 09:27:23","e55158","","2","8","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/K874VEN4/Syfert et al. - 2013 - The Effects of Sampling Bias and Model Complexity .pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/U3XLNGMA/article.html","","","Geographic distribution; Trees; Theoretical ecology; Environmental geography; Ferns; New Zealand; Plant ecology; Vascular plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.","2011-03-09","2019-01-07 14:45:35","2019-01-07 14:45:35","","e17622","","3","6","","PLoS ONE","Wild bird migration across the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21408010 PMCID: PMC3052365","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZWTMCWZ4/Prosser et al. - 2011 - Wild bird migration across the Qinghai-Tibetan pla.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21408010","","Animal Migration; Animals; Animals, Wild; Birds; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Geese; Geography; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Phylogeny; Poultry; Regression Analysis; Seasons; Breeding; Fresh Water; Wetlands; Tibet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild waterfowl (family Anatidae) are reported as secondary transmitters of HPAIV and primary reservoirs for low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, yet spatial inputs for disease risk modeling for this group have been lacking. Using geographic information software and Monte Carlo simulations, we developed geospatial indices of waterfowl abundance at 1 and 30 km resolutions and for the breeding and wintering seasons for China, the epicenter of H5N1. Two spatial layers were developed: cumulative waterfowl abundance (WAB), a measure of predicted abundance across species, and cumulative abundance weighted by H5N1 prevalence (WPR), whereby abundance for each species was adjusted based on prevalence values and then totaled across species. Spatial patterns of the model output differed between seasons, with higher WAB and WPR in the northern and western regions of China for the breeding season and in the southeast for the wintering season. Uncertainty measures indicated highest error in southeastern China for both WAB and WPR. We also explored the effect of resampling waterfowl layers from 1 to 30 km resolution for multiscale risk modeling. Results indicated low average difference (less than 0.16 and 0.01 standard deviations for WAB and WPR, respectively), with greatest differences in the north for the breeding season and southeast for the wintering season. This work provides the first geospatial models of waterfowl abundance available for China. The indices provide important inputs for modeling disease transmission risk at the interface of poultry and wild birds. These models are easily adaptable, have broad utility to both disease and conservation needs, and will be available to the scientific community for advanced modeling applications.","2016","2019-01-07 14:45:37","2019-01-07 14:45:37","","329-336","","1 Suppl","60","","Avian Dis.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27309075","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309075","","Animals; Animals, Wild; Birds; China; H5N1; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Models, Biological; Seasons; Virulence; spatial modeling; waterfowl; GIS; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of migratory birds, a collection of migration routes, known as a flyway, is often hundreds to thousands of kilometers long and can extend across political boundaries. Flyways encompass the entire geographic range between the breeding and non-breeding areas of a population, species, or a group of species, and they provide spatial frameworks for management and conservation across international borders. Existing flyway maps are largely qualitative accounts based on band returns and survey data rather than observed movement routes. In this study, we use satellite and GPS telemetry data and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to build upon existing maps and describe waterfowl space use probabilistically in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. RESULTS: Our approach provided new information on migratory routes that was not easily attainable with existing methods to describe flyways. Utilization distributions from dynamic Brownian bridge movement models identified key staging and stopover sites, migration corridors and general flyway outlines in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. A map of space use from ruddy shelducks depicted two separate movement corridors within the Central Asian Flyway, likely representing two distinct populations that show relatively strong connectivity between breeding and wintering areas. Bar-headed geese marked at seven locations in the Central Asian Flyway showed heaviest use at several stopover sites in the same general region of high-elevation lakes along the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our analysis of data from multiple Anatidae species marked at sites throughout Asia highlighted major movement corridors across species and confirmed that the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways were spatially distinct. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic Brownian bridge movement model improves our understanding of flyways by estimating relative use of regions in the flyway while providing detailed, quantitative information on migration timing and population connectivity including uncertainty between locations. This model effectively quantifies the relative importance of different migration corridors and stopover sites and may help prioritize specific areas in flyways for conservation of waterbird populations.","2015","2019-01-07 14:45:40","2019-01-07 14:45:40","","3","","1","3","","Mov Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25709838 PMCID: PMC4337761","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/4WA5UV76/Palm et al. - 2015 - Mapping migratory flyways in Asia using dynamic Br.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25709838","","Migration; Waterfowl; Dynamic Brownian bridge movement model; Flyways; Habitat conservation; Space use; Stopover sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two countries, Indonesia and Egypt, have formally declared the disease endemic to the World Organisation for Animal Health, while others have used a variety of approaches aimed at containment, control, and eradication. These approaches have achieved variable success, but in 2009 several countries that had previously declared themselves free of HPNAI became reinfected. In addition, the virus continued to be detected widely in wild bird populations, even in the absence of local poultry outbreaks. Other poultry outbreaks with HPNAI have been reported in South Africa (in ostriches with H5N2 in 2006) and the U.K. (in chickens with H7N7 in 2008). Also notable was the report of H5N2 HPNAI in wild bird populations in North Africa in 2007. Improved active surveillance systems and vigilance for notifiable avian influenza (NAI) in domestic poultry, especially in host groupings, in which clinical signs following infection may be inapparent (e.g., domestic waterfowl), have inevitably resulted in the detection and reporting of other activity. Low pathogenicity NAI H5 or H7 viruses were isolated/detected from poultry in Belgium (H5N2, 2008), Chinese Taipei (H5N2, 2008), Denmark (H5N2, 2006; H7N1, 2008), France (H5N2, 2007), Germany (H7N3, 2008), Italy (H7N7, 2006; H7N3, 2007–08), the Netherlands (H7N7, 2006), Portugal (H5N2, 2007; H5N3, 2007), the Republic of Korea (H7N8, 2007; H5N2, 2008), and the U.K. (H7N3, 2006; H7N2, 2007).

Three broad factors, occurring concurrently, prevent elimination of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by viruses of the H5N1 subtype (H5N1 HPAI) in countries and subregions where infection has remained endemic. These factors are the nature of the poultry sector, the quality of veterinary and animal production services (both public and private) serving the poultry industry, and the extent and level of commitment at all levels to virus elimination. Most of these countries have developed and adopted programs for progressive control of H5N1 HPAI, focused on the local factors hindering elimination of the viruses. Based on the rate of implementation of these measures over the last 5 to 7 yr (during which time there has been unprecedented financial and technical support from the international donor community), it is not expected that global eradication of H5N1 HPAI viruses can be achieved within the next 10 yr. If the “classical” approach to control, based around early case detection and culling, were adopted in a zone containing millions of free-running ducks, the work load required to complete even the first round of testing would exceed existing capacity. There would be no guarantees of sustained success locally, especially if the viruses are not eradicated regionally.","2012-07-17","2019-01-08 08:48:55","2019-01-08 08:48:55","2019-01-08 08:48:55","829-835","","4s1","56","","Avian Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","aaapjournals.info (Atypon)","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/9MPT3JSH/Sims - 2012 - Progress in Control of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avia.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FT3CUCG6/10198-041012-Review.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.","2008","2019-01-08 13:34:18","2019-01-08 13:34:18","2019-01-08 13:34:18","2712-2724","","10","89","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2008 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/GWS9LNIC/McRae et al. - 2008 - Using Circuit Theory to Model Connectivity in Ecol.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3CAGXKVT/07-1861.html","","","dispersal; circuit theory; effective distance; gene flow; graph theory; habitat fragmentation; isolation; landscape connectivity; metapopulation theory; reserve design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The precise effects under field conditions of most individual interventions applied to control and prevent avian influenza have not been established or subjected to critical review, often because a number of measures are applied simultaneously without controls.

In the current simulation approach epidemiological and economic models are combined to compare different strategies to control highly pathogenic avian influenza in Dutch poultry flocks. Evaluated control strategies are the minimum EU strategy (i.e., culling of infected flocks, transport regulations, tracing and screening of contact flocks, establishment of protection and surveillance zones), and additional control strategies comprising pre-emptive culling of all susceptible poultry flocks in an area around infected flocks (1km, 3km and 10km) and emergency vaccination of all flocks except broilers around infected flocks (3km). Simulation results indicate that the EU strategy is not sufficient to eradicate an epidemic in high density poultry areas. From an epidemiological point of view, this strategy is the least effective, while pre-emptive culling in 10km radius is the most effective of the studied strategies. But these two strategies incur the highest costs due to long duration (EU strategy) and large-scale culling (pre-emptive culling in 10km radius). Other analysed pre-emptive culling strategies (i.e., in 1km and 3km radius) are more effective than the analysed emergency vaccination strategy (in 3km radius) in terms of duration and size of the epidemics, despite the assumed optimistic vaccination capacity of 20 farms per day. However, the total costs of these strategies differ only marginally. Extending the capacity for culling substantially reduces the duration, size and costs of the epidemic. This study demonstrates the strength of combining epidemiological and economic model analysis to gain insight in a range of consequences and thus to serve as a decision support tool in the control of HPAI epidemics.","2015-09-01","2019-01-11 04:33:28","2019-01-11 04:33:28","2019-01-11 04:33:28","142-150","","1","121","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Controlling highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/MGCI83D6/Backer et al. - 2015 - Controlling highly pathogenic avian influenza outb.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3RFGZZ44/S0167587715002184.html","","","HPAI; Highly pathogenic avian influenza; Vaccination; Epidemiological model; Control strategy; Economic assessment; Pre-emptive culling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mathematical model has been developed which indicated that virus amplification and spread may take place when wild bird populations of sufficient size within EU become infected. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) may reach similar maximum prevalence levels in wild bird populations to HPAIV but the risk of LPAIV infection of a poultry holding was estimated to be lower than that of HPAIV. Only few non-wild bird pathways were identified having a non-negligible risk of AI introduction. The transmission rate between animals within a flock is assessed to be higher for HPAIV than LPAIV. In very few cases, it could be proven that HPAI outbreaks were caused by intrinsic mutation of LPAIV to HPAIV but current knowledge does not allow a prediction as to if, and when this could occur. In gallinaceous poultry, passive surveillance through notification of suspicious clinical signs/mortality was identified as the most effective method for early detection of HPAI outbreaks. For effective surveillance in anseriform poultry, passive surveillance through notification of suspicious clinical signs/mortality needs to be accompanied by serological surveillance and/or a virological surveillance programme of birds found dead (bucket sampling). Serosurveillance is unfit for early warning of LPAI outbreaks at the individual holding level but could be effective in tracing clusters of LPAIV-infected holdings. In wild birds, passive surveillance is an appropriate method for HPAIV surveillance if the HPAIV infections are associated with mortality whereas active wild bird surveillance has a very low efficiency for detecting HPAIV. Experts estimated and emphasised the effect of implementing specific biosecurity measures on reducing the probability of AIV entering into a poultry holding. Human diligence is pivotal to select, implement and maintain specific, effective biosecurity measures.","2017-10-01","2019-01-11 04:25:20","2019-01-11 04:25:20","2019-01-11 04:25:20","e04991","","10","15","","EFSA Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/R4535T7M/More et al. - 2017 - Avian influenza.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/T8FIBIZE/j.efsa.2017.html","","","surveillance; avian influenza; biosecurity; introduction; mutagenesis; spread; zoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we argue that the challenges are best met by combining multiple models and modelling approaches that elucidate the various epidemiological, ecological and social processes at work. These models should not be understood as neutral science informing policy in a linear manner, but as having social and political lives: social, cultural and political norms and values that shape their development and which they carry and project. We develop and illustrate this argument in relation to the cases of H5N1 avian influenza and Ebola, exploring for each the range of modelling approaches deployed and the ways they have been co-constructed with a particular politics of policy. Addressing the complex, uncertain dynamics of zoonotic disease requires such social and political lives to be made explicit in approaches that aim at triangulation rather than integration, and plural and conditional rather than singular forms of policy advice.","2013-07-01","2019-01-11 03:20:33","2019-01-11 03:20:33","2019-01-11 03:20:32","10-17","","","88","","Social Science & Medicine","The social and political lives of zoonotic disease models","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/KI6JFLCR/Leach and Scoones - 2013 - The social and political lives of zoonotic disease.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QKJ7775B/S0277953613001792.html","","","H5N1; Modelling; Zoonoses; Ebola; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild birds have played an important role in the spread of H5N1 HPAI. To understand its spatial distribution, H5N1 HPAI have been studied by many disciplines from different perspectives, but only one kind of disciplinary knowledge was involved, which has provided limited progress in understanding. Combining risk information from different disciplines based on knowledge fusion can provide more accurate and detailed information. In this study, local k function, phylogenetic tree analysis, and logistic spatial autoregressive models were used to explore the global spatial pattern of H5N1 HPAI based on outbreak data in wild birds, genetic sequences, and risk factors, respectively. On this basis, Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory was further applied to study the spatial distribution of H5N1 HPAI. We found D-S evidence theory was more robust and reliable than the other three methods, providing technical and methodological support for application to the research of other diseases. The shortest distance to wild bird migration routes, roads and railways, elevation, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use and land cover (LULC) and infant mortality rates (IMR) were significantly associated with the occurrence of H5N1 HPAI. The high-risk areas were mainly located in Northern and Central Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, and East and Southeast Asia. High-risk clusters were closely related to the social, economic and ecological environment of the region. Locations where the potential transmission risk remains high should be prioritized for control efforts.","2018-04-01","2019-01-10 08:01:04","2019-01-10 08:01:04","2019-01-10 08:01:04","32-39","","","152","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","Global spatial risk pattern of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in wild birds","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/X6A26ZBE/S0167587717305007.html; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/N3VCIZTG/Sun et al. - 2018 - Global spatial risk pattern of highly pathogenic a.pdf","","","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory; Global distribution; Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1; Point pattern analysis; Spatial distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With an estimated case fatality rate of up to 60%, it is vital to map the existing digital technologies that may be utilized to improve disease monitoring and health outcomes for avian influenza. This scoping review aimed to identify which digital technologies may improve disease prevention, detection and control, and could be used as a basis for strengthening health systems. A search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for studies that reported the utilization of digital technologies with specific reference to avian influenza. Search dates ranged from 2009 (January) to 2017 (July). Data was extracted into a summative table, citations managed using EndNote software and data synthesized through grouping digital technology domains, using narrative and graphical methods. The scoping review identified 111 relevant studies, and revealed data modelling (n=72) and novel technologies (n=15) referring primarily to diagnostic tools, to be the most utilized technologies in tackling avian influenza. A large portion of the data-modelling domain was compromised of computer-assisted mathematical modelling (n=42) including mathematical modelling (n=8), simulation modelling (n=14) and spatioal-temporal modelling (n=20), primarily used to estimate outbreak distribution according to migratory patterns and transmission dynamics. A major challenge reported was poor biosecurity measures of poultry markets. Digital technologies indicated potential in improving disease detection, control and prevention, particularly through the use of data modelling with meteorological data sets. However, it became evident, that to maximize potential of these digital technologies better implementation of biosecurity measures would be necessary in majorly affected regions such as Asia.","2018-06-30","2019-01-10 07:17:04","2019-01-10 07:17:04","2019-01-10 07:17:04","","","6","2","","","Taking flight with Precision Global Health","","","","","","","en","","","","","jphe.amegroups.com","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/JCY9DMQD/Bempong et al. - 2018 - Taking flight with Precision Global Health a scop.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/SW33UHQW/5377.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors emphasise that in the case of HPAI transmission in poultry there are important gaps in our understanding. Due to these gaps the models for the effects of certain control strategies, especially those involving vaccination of poultry, need to be based on provisional assumptions.

Our presentation complements existing work by clarifying the major differences between modelling approaches and their relationship with the biological characteristics of the epidemiological system. We first discuss distinct motivations for using process models in epidemiological research, identifying the key steps in model design and use associated with each. We then present a conceptual framework for guiding model construction and comparison, organised according to key aspects of epidemiological systems. Specifically, we discuss the number and type of disease states, whether to focus on individual hosts (e.g. cows) or groups of hosts (e.g. herds or farms), how space or host connectivity affect disease transmission, whether demographic and epidemiological processes are periodic or can occur at any time, and the extent to which stochasticity is important. We use foot-and-mouth disease and bovine Tuberculosis in cattle to illustrate our discussion and support explanations of cases in which different models are used to address similar problems. The framework should help those constructing models to structure their approach to modelling decisions and facilitate comparisons between models in the literature.","2017","2019-01-09 08:19:26","2019-01-09 08:19:26","2019-01-09 08:19:26","","","","4","","Front.

Here, we report isolation and characterization of H5N1 viruses isolated from ducks and turkeys in Kerala, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh, India between November 2014 and March 2015. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of haemagglutinin gene identified that the virus belonged to a new clade 2.3.2.1c which has not been detected earlier in Indian poultry. The virus possessed molecular signature for high pathogenicity to chickens, which was corroborated by intravenous pathogenicity index of 2.96. The virus was a reassortant which derives its PB2 gene from H9N2 virus isolated in China during 2007–2013. However, the neuraminidase and internal genes are of H5N1 subtype. Phylogenetic and network analysis revealed that after detection in China in 2013/2014, the virus moved to Europe, West Africa and other Asian countries including India. The analyses further indicated multiple introductions of H5N1 virus in Indian poultry and internal spread in Kerala. One of the outbreaks in ducks in Kerala is linked to the H5N1 virus isolated from wild birds in Dubai suggesting movement of virus probably through migration of wild birds. However, the outbreaks in ducks in Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh were from an unknown source in Asia which also contributed gene pools to the outbreaks in Europe and West Africa. The widespread incidence of the novel H5N1 HPAI is similar to the spread of clade 2.2 (“Qinghai-like”) virus in 2005, and should be monitored to avoid threat to animal and public health.","2016-09-01","2019-01-09 00:48:26","2019-01-09 00:48:26","2019-01-09 00:48:26","173-178","","","43","","Infection, Genetics and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/DVVEYYQD/S1567134816301848.html","","","Reassortment; Highly pathogenic avian influenza; India; Turkey; H5N1 subtype; Duck","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, different models and model parameterizations may provide different prediction of outcomes. In other fields of research, ensemble modeling has been used to combine multiple projections. We explore the possibility of applying such methods to epidemiology by adapting Bayesian techniques developed for climate forecasting. We exemplify the implementation with single model ensembles based on different parameterizations of the Warwick model run for the 2001 United Kingdom foot and mouth disease outbreak and compare the efficacy of different control actions. This allows us to investigate the effect that discrepancy among projections based on different modeling assumptions has on the ensemble prediction. A sensitivity analysis showed that the choice of prior can have a pronounced effect on the posterior estimates of quantities of interest, in particular for ensembles with large discrepancy among projections. However, by using a hierarchical extension of the method we show that prior sensitivity can be circumvented. We further extend the method to include a priori beliefs about different modeling assumptions and demonstrate that the effect of this can have different consequences depending on the discrepancy among projections. We propose that the method is a promising analytical tool for ensemble modeling of disease outbreaks.","2015-04-30","2019-01-14 10:49:33","2019-01-14 10:49:33","2019-01-14 10:49:33","e1004187","","4","11","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/XDL5GGNW/Lindström et al. - 2015 - A Bayesian Ensemble Approach for Epidemiological P.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FAZYHRQV/article.html","","","Epidemiology; Forecasting; Infectious disease control; Farms; Climate change; Epidemiological methods and statistics; Probability distribution; Simulation and modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variants of circulating or newly emerging IAVs continue to trigger global health threats annually for both humans and animals.

Influenza A viruses detected over the past century in the majority of mammalian hosts can be phylogenetically traced back to their ancestors in waterfowl or shorebirds. Although many wild bird species may harbor avian influenza viruses, birds belonging to the Anseriformes (ducks, geese, and swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, and waders) constitute the primary natural virus reservoir. Avian influenza viruses are primarily transmitted via the fecal–oral route, which allows the effective transmission of influenza A viruses between susceptible birds and potentially allows temporal and spatial connectivity of virus populations in different host (sub)populations. Avian influenza viruses are normally asymptomatic in wild birds, or cause mild disease in poultry, and therefore are termed low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. However, the acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinin protein genes of H5 and H7 subtype influenza A viruses can cause a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus resulting in severe disease in poultry and wild birds. In this chapter, we review the avian influenza virus literature to discuss the ecology and evolution of LPAI and HPAI viruses in birds.","2017-01-01","2019-01-15 15:06:46","2019-01-15 15:06:46","2019-01-15 15:06:46","621-640","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier","London","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-799942-5.00027-5","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/FPB5NJBQ/Hurt et al. - 2017 - 27 - Ecology and Evolution of Avian Influenza Viru.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/Q2ZM3WIG/B9780127999425000275.html","","","Evolution; Influenza; Migration; Ecology; Avian; Genetics","Tibayrenc, Michel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In November 2016, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N8 emerged in poultry in the country. As of 23 March 2017, a total of 484 confirmed outbreaks were reported, with consequences on animal health and socio-economic impacts for producers. Methods: We examined the spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that occurred in France between November 2016 and March 2017, using the space–time K-function and space–time permutation model of the scan statistic test. Results: Most outbreaks affected duck flocks in south-west France. A significant space–time interaction of outbreaks was present at the beginning of the epidemic within a window of 8 km and 13 days. This interaction disappeared towards the epidemic end. Five spatio-temporal outbreak clusters were identified in the main poultry producing areas, moving sequentially from east to west. The average spread rate of the epidemic front wave was estimated to be 5.5 km/week. It increased from February 2017 and was negatively associated with the duck holding density. Conclusion: HPAI-H5N8 infections varied over time and space in France. Intense transmission events occurred at the early stages of the epidemic, followed by long-range jumps in the disease spread towards its end. Findings support strict control strategies in poultry production as well as the maintenance of high biosecurity standards for poultry holdings. Factors and mechanisms driving HPAI spread need to be further investigated.","2018-06-28","2019-01-15 12:16:25","2019-01-15 12:16:25","2019-01-15 12:16:26","1700791","","26","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.eurosurveillance.org","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/3EZAQEG2/Guinat et al. - 2018 - Spatio-temporal patterns of highly pathogenic avia.pdf; /Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/6H2JS85U/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.26.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary data from 91 poultry farms (duck farms, broiler chicken and backyard poultry), four hatcheries and 90 backwater boat owners were collected through pre-tested schedules. The secondary data on transfer payments and expenditure incurred to control AI were collected from developmental departments and were analysed. The estimated loss (culling live birds, eggs and feed destruction) per duck farm was USD 9,181, USD 3,889 and USD 156 in case of commercial farms reared for meat, dual-purpose and backyard farms, respectively. The loss incurred by small-scale broiler and backyard poultry farms was USD 453 and USD 40, respectively. The loss incurred by large and small duck hatcheries was USD 11,963 and USD 5,790, respectively, due to culling of hatchlings, young birds and destroying eggs. The government invested USD 744,890 to contain the disease spread through massive culling, surveillance and monitoring of poultry and humans due to zoonotic nature of the disease. A sharp market reaction on own and substitute product prices and eight weeks’ time lag in price recovery was observed. The consequential impact on tourism especially for the backwater boat operators amounted to a loss of USD 2,280/boat due to fall in tourist inflow.

The H5N1 HPAI panzootic affecting Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe has been the largest among these, affecting poultry and/or wild birds in 63 countries. A stamping-out programme achieved eradication in 24 of these epizootics (and is close to achieving eradication in the current H5N2 epizootic in South African ostriches), but vaccination was added to the control programmes in four epizootics when stamping out alone was not effective. During the 2002 to 2010 period, more than 113 billion doses of avian influenza (AI) vaccine were used in at-risk national poultry populations of over 131 billion birds. At two to three doses per bird for the 15 vaccinating countries, the average national vaccination coverage rate was 41.9% and the global AI vaccine coverage rate was 10.9% for all poultry. The highest national coverage rate was nearly 100% for poultry in Hong Kong and the lowest national coverage was less than 0.01% for poultry in Israel and the Netherlands. Inactivated AI vaccines accounted for 95.5% and live recombinant virus vaccines for 4.5% of the vaccines used. Most of these vaccines were used in the H5N1 HPAI panzootic, with more than 99% employed in the People’s Republic of China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. Implementation of vaccination in these four countries occurred after H5N1 HPAI became enzootic in domestic poultry and vaccination did not result in the enzootic infections. Vaccine usage prevented clinical disease and mortality in chickens, and maintained rural livelihoods and food security during HPAI outbreaks. Low-pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI) became reportable to the World Organisation for Animal Health in 2006 because some H5 and H7 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have the potential to mutate to HPAI viruses. Fewer outbreaks of LPNAI have been reported than of HPAI and only six countries used vaccine in control programmes, accounting for 8.1% of the total H5/H7 AI vaccine usage, as compared to 91.9% of the vaccine used against HPAI. Of the six countries that have used vaccine to control LPNAI, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Italy have been the biggest users. In countries with enzootic HPAI and LPNAI, development and implementation of exit strategies has been difficult.","2011-12-01","2019-01-14 15:45:44","2019-01-14 15:45:45","2019-01-14 15:45:44","839-870","","3","30","","","Assessment of national strategies for control of high-pathogenicity avian influenza and lowpathogenicity notifiable avian influenza in poultry, with emphasis on vaccines and vaccination","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/QSS2M58V/Swayne et al. - 2011 - Assessment of national strategies for control of h.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L.","Evaluating the risk of avian influenza introduction and spread among poultry exhibition flocks in Australia","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","","1873-1716","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.11.018","","Some practices undertaken by poultry exhibitors, such as allowing wild birds to contact domestic birds, the high frequency of bird movements and the lack of appropriate isolation for incoming birds, pose a risk for disease introduction and spread. The aim of the current study was to quantitatively assess the probability of introduction of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses from wild waterfowl into poultry exhibition flocks and the subsequent spread to other poultry flocks. Exposure and consequence assessments, using scenario trees and Monte Carlo stochastic simulation modelling, were conducted to identify potential pathways of introduction and spread and calculate the probabilities of these pathways occurring. Input parameters were estimated from two recently conducted cross-sectional studies among poultry exhibitors in Australia (Dusan et al., 2010; Hernández-Jover et al., 2013) and other scientific literature. According to reported practices of poultry exhibitors and the LPAI prevalence in wild birds in Australia, this assessment estimates a median (5-95%) probability of exposure of a bird kept by a poultry exhibitor of 0.004 (0.003-0.005). Due to the higher susceptibility of infection of turkeys and waterfowl, this probability is higher in flocks keeping these bird species than in those keeping chickens or pigeons only. Similarly, once exposure has occurred, establishment of infection and subsequent spread are more likely in those flocks keeping waterfowl and turkeys than in those keeping chicken and pigeons only. Spread through movement of birds is the most likely pathway of spread, followed by contaminated fomites, wild birds and airborne spread. The median probability of LPAI spread through movement of birds in flocks keeping waterfowl and turkeys was estimated to be 0.280 (0.123-0.541) and 0.230 (0.104-0.421), respectively. A lower probability was estimated for chicken (0.087; 0.027-0.202) and pigeon (0.0003; 3.0×10(-5)-0.0008) flocks. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the prevalence of LPAI in wild waterfowl and the probability of contact of domestic birds with wild waterfowl are the most influential parameters on the probability of exposure; while the probability of spread is mostly influenced by the probability of movement of birds and the probability of the exhibitor detecting and reporting LPAI. To minimize the potential risk of AI introduction and spread, poultry exhibitors should prevent contact of domestic birds with wild birds, and implement appropriate biosecurity practices. In addition, adequate extension services are required to improve exhibitors' abilities to recognize diseases and reporting behaviour.","2015-01-01","2019-01-14 12:17:08","2019-01-14 12:17:08","","128-141","","1","118","","Prev.

China is home to the largest population of chickens (4.83 billion) and ducks (0.694 billion), representing, respectively 23.1 and 58.6% of the 2013 world stock, with a significant part of poultry sold through live-poultry markets potentially contributing to the spread of avian influenza viruses. Previous models have looked at factors associated with HPAI H5N1 in poultry and LPAI H7N9 in markets. However, these have not been studied and compared with a consistent set of predictor variables. Significant progress was recently made in the collection of poultry census and live-poultry market data, which are key potential factors in the distribution of both diseases. Here we compiled and reprocessed a new set of poultry census data and used these to analyse HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 distributions with boosted regression trees models. We found a limited impact of the improved poultry layers compared to models based on previous poultry census data, and a positive and previously unreported association between HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and the density of live-poultry markets. In addition, the models fitted for the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 viruses predict a high risk of disease presence for the area around Shanghai and Hong Kong. The main difference in prediction between the two viruses concerned the suitability of HPAI H5N1 in north-China around the Yellow sea (outlined with Tianjin, Beijing, and Shenyang city) where LPAI H7N9 has not spread intensely.","2017","2019-01-14 12:15:53","2019-01-14 12:15:53","","393-402","","2","31","","Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess","H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza suitability models for China","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28298880 PMCID: PMC5329093","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/IE8ZJNLH/Artois et al. - 2017 - H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza suitability models f.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298880","","Avian influenza; Spatial epidemiology; HPAI H5N1; LPAI H7N9; Poultry data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we apply both phylodynamic and phylogenetic community ecology techniques to examine the consequences of pathogen heterogeneity on transmission by assessing subtype-specific transmission pathways in a social carnivore. We use comprehensive social and spatial network data to examine transmission pathways for three subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle ) in African lions (Panthera leo) at multiple scales in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used FIVPle molecular data to examine the role of social organization and lion density in shaping transmission pathways and tested to what extent vertical (i.e., father- and/or mother-offspring relationships) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) transmission underpinned these patterns for each subtype. Using the same data, we constructed subtype-specific FIVPle co-occurrence networks and assessed what combination of social networks, spatial networks or co-infection best structured the FIVPle network. While social organization (i.e., pride) was an important component of FIVPle transmission pathways at all scales, we find that FIVPle subtypes exhibited different transmission pathways at within- and between-pride scales. A combination of social and spatial networks, coupled with consideration of subtype co-infection, was likely to be important for FIVPle transmission for the two major subtypes, but the relative contribution of each factor was strongly subtype-specific. Our study provides evidence that pathogen heterogeneity is important in understanding pathogen transmission, which could have consequences for how endemic pathogens are managed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community phylogenetic ecology coupled with phylodynamic techniques can reveal insights into the differential evolutionary pressures acting on virus subtypes, which can manifest into landscape-level effects.","2017","2019-01-16 13:38:25","2019-01-16 13:38:25","","1469-1482","","6","86","","J Anim Ecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28884827","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/VBI6BA4Y/Fountain-Jones et al. - 2017 - Linking social and spatial networks to viral commu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884827","","Animals; Coinfection; community ecology; feline immunodeficiency virus; generalized dissimilarity modelling; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; landscape ecology; Lentivirus Infections; Lions; OTU networks; phylogenetic diversity; Phylogeny; Social Behavior; social systems; Tanzania; transmission mode; wildlife disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These pathogens are transmitted by ticks and infect multiple, taxonomically distinct, host species. From an epidemiological perspective, it is important to determine whether genetic variants within the species complex are able to spread freely through the whole host community or, instead, if certain variants are restricted to particular hosts. To this end, we characterized the genotypes of members of the B. burgdorferi species complex; the bacteria were isolated from more than two hundred individuals captured in the wild and belonging to three different rodent host species. For each individual, we used a high-throughput approach to amplify and sequence rplB, a housekeeping gene, and ospC, which is involved in infection. This approach allowed us to evaluate the genetic diversity both within and among species in the B. burgdorferi species complex. Strong evidence of genetic differentiation among host species was revealed by both genes, even though they are, a priori, not constrained by the same selective pressures. These data are discussed in the context of the advancements made possible by multi-locus high-throughput sequencing and current knowledge of Lyme disease epidemiology.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:30","2019-01-16 13:39:30","","e88581","","2","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24533116 PMCID: PMC3922933","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/2IBXSGNS/Jacquot et al. - 2014 - High-throughput sequence typing reveals genetic di.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533116","","Algorithms; Animals; Antigens, Bacterial; Arvicolinae; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Borrelia burgdorferi; Genetic Variation; Genotype; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host Specificity; Mice; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Sciuridae; Sequence Alignment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These features make the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex an attractive biological model that can be used to study the diversification and the epidemiology of endemic bacterial pathogens. We investigated the potential of population genomic approaches to study these processes. Sixty-three strains belonging to three species within the Borrelia burgdorferi complex were isolated from questing ticks in Alsace (France), a region where Lyme disease is highly endemic. We first aimed to characterize the degree of genetic isolation among the species sampled. Phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses revealed clear delineations: there was a ∼50 fold difference between intra-specific and inter-specific recombination rates. We then investigated whether the population genomic data contained information of epidemiological relevance. In phylogenies inferred using most of the genome, conspecific strains did not cluster in clades. These results raise questions about the relevance of different strategies when investigating pathogen epidemiology. For instance, here, both classical analytic approaches and phylodynamic simulations suggested that population sizes and migration rates were higher in B. garinii populations, which are normally associated with birds, than in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations. The phylogenetic analyses of the infection-related ospC gene and its flanking region provided additional support for this finding. Traces of recombination among the B. burgdorferi s.s. lineages and lineages associated with small mammals were found, suggesting that they shared the same hosts. Altogether, these results provide baseline evidence that can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the host range of B. burgdorferi lineages based on population genomic data.","2014","2019-01-16 13:39:51","2019-01-16 13:39:51","","e94384","","4","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24721934 PMCID: PMC3993988","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/ZFAE5X47/Jacquot et al. - 2014 - Comparative population genomics of the Borrelia bu.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721934","","Animals; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Birds; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Disease Vectors; France; Genetic Variation; Genome, Bacterial; Host Specificity; Humans; Lyme Disease; Mammals; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Reproductive Isolation; Ticks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disentangling transmission patterns in such systems is often challenging, yet investigating how different host species contribute to transmission is crucial to properly assess and manage disease risk. We aim to reveal transmission cycles of bacteria within the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, which include Lyme disease agents. We characterized Borrelia genotypes found in 488 infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs collected in the Sénart Forest located near Paris (France). These genotypes were compared to those observed in three sympatric species of small mammals and network analyses reveal four independent transmission cycles. Statistical modelling shows that two cycles involving chipmunks, an introduced species, and non-sampled host species such as birds, are responsible for the majority of tick infections. In contrast, the cycle involving native bank voles only accounts for a small proportion of infected ticks. Genotypes associated with the two primary transmission cycles were isolated from Lyme disease patients, confirming the epidemiological threat posed by these strains. Our work demonstrates that combining high-throughput sequence typing with networks tools and statistical modeling is a promising approach for characterizing transmission cycles of multi-host pathogens in complex ecological settings.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:06","2019-01-16 13:40:06","","31273","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27498685 PMCID: PMC4976386","","/Users/mgilbert/Dropbox/1_Work/9-Library/storage/A2CK4W9U/Jacquot et al. - 2016 - Multiple independent transmission cycles of a tick.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27498685","","Animals; Birds; Borrelia burgdorferi; Disease Reservoirs; Ecology; Forests; France; Genotype; Humans; Introduced Species; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Phylogeny; Sciuridae; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Zoonoses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiological agents are spirochete bacteria that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.) complex and are transmitted by hard ticks among a large range of vertebrate hosts. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector. In the absence of a vaccine and given the current difficulties to diagnose and treat chronic Lyme syndromes, there is urgent need for prevention. In this context, accurate information on the spatial patterns of risk of exposure to ticks is of prime importance for public health. The objective of our study was to provide a snapshot map of the risk of human infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. pathogens in a periurban forest at a high resolution, and to analyze the factors that contribute to variation in this risk. Field monitoring took place over three weeks in May 2011 in the suburban Sénart forest (3,200ha; southeast of Paris), which receives over 3 million people annually. We sampled ticks over the entire forest area (from 220 forest stands with a total area of 35,200m(2)) and quantified the density of questing nymphs (DON), the prevalence of infection among nymphs (NIP), and the density of infected nymphs (DIN), which is the most important predictor of the human risk of Lyme borreliosis. For each of these response variables, we explored the relative roles of weather (saturation deficit), hosts (abundance indices of ungulates and Tamias sibiricus, an introduced rodent species), vegetation and forest cover, superficial soil composition, and the distance to forest roads. In total, 19,546 questing nymphs were collected and the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. was tested in 3,903 nymphs by qPCR. The mean DON was 5.6 nymphs per 10m(2) (standard deviation=10.4) with an average NIP of 10.1% (standard deviation=0.11). The highest DIN was 8.9 infected nymphs per 10m(2), with a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation=0.6). Our mapping and modeling revealed a strong heterogeneity of risk within the forest. The highest risk was found in the eastern part of the forest and localized patches in the northwestern part. Lyme borreliosis risk was positively associated with stands of deciduous trees (mainly oaks) and roe deer abundance. Contrary to expectations, DIN actually increased with distance from the point of introduction of T. sibiricus (i.e., DIN was higher in areas with potentially lower abundances of T. sibiricus). Thus, despite the fact that T. sibiricus is an important reservoir host for B. burgdorferi s. l., our study found that other explanatory factors played a more important role in determining the density of infected ticks. Precise mapping of the risk of exposure to Lyme borreliosis in a highly visited forest represents an important tool for targeting prevention and control measures, as well as making the general public and local health officials aware of the risks.","2016","2019-01-16 13:40:19","2019-01-16 13:40:19","","644-652","","5","7","","Ticks Tick Borne Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26897396","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897396","","Acarological risk map; Animals; Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorferi Group; Forests; Humans; Ixodes; Ixodes ricinus; Lyme Disease; Nymph; Paris; Population Density; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Assessment; Sciuridae; Tick density; Tick infection prevalence; Ticks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
