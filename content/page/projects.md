# Current projects  


### GeoAccessHealth: The availability and accessibility of health services in space and time: analytical assessment, data integration and real-time visualization (2019-2020)  
*Funded by Innoviris*  

This projects aims to develop and implement semi-automatique procedures to quantify the accessibility of patients to healthcare facilities in sub-saharan Africa.


### MONODIS: Influence of the distribution, extent and fragmentation of pine stands in Europe on the distribution and abundance of Monochamus spp., the vectors of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. (2019)  
*Funded by SPF Santé Publique*  

This project aims to map the distribution of *Monochamus spp.*, the vectors of *Bursaphelenchus xylophilus* at the European scale as a function of forest and climate predictor spatial variables. This collaborative project is compiling presence and absence data from a large number of traps collected throughout Europe, and these data are then used to inform species distributions models to predic the probability of occurrence of the species at an European scale. 


### OneChick: One Health Poultry Hub (2019-2024)  
*Funded by GCRF*  

The demand for poultry products in Asia has been particularly fast in the last few decades, following urban growth, urbanization and increase in wealth leading to changes in dietary preferences. This very fast growth poses many challenges in terms of animal and public health linked to emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza, to foodborne pathogens or to the overuse of antimicrobials. Small-scale poultry farming plays an important role in terms of livelihood and is an important source of protein and income to millions of smallholders. OneChick is a large multistakeholder project which aims to investigate approaches for sustainable intensification of poultry production in Asia. Our role in the project will be to work on the present and future geographical distribution of poultry production, demand and markets in the project focus countries: Bangladesh, India, Sri-Lanka and Vietnam.

### PALE-Blu: Understanding pathogen, livestock, environment interactions involving bluetongue virus (2017-2020)
*Funded by EU H2020*

New outbreaks caused by bluetongue viruses (BTVs) have emerged in European livestock every year since 1998. These events that have been linked to climate change, resulted in massive losses due to fatalities, reduced productivity, reproductive failures, restricted animal movements/trade, and surveillance/vaccination costs. PALE-Blu brings together European institutes with expertise in BTV research and diagnosis, with partners in endemic regions (Africa, the Middle East and Turkey) that act as a ‘source’ for BTV strains that emerge in Europe. Our role in the project it to lead the spatial modelling work package, which aims to better understand how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence the spread of the disease, using spatial modelling and landscape phylogenetic approaches.

### Mapping the transition toward more sustainable livestock production systems (2017-2021)
*Funded by FNRS PDR-WISD*

Many livestock production systems (LPS) are in a state of transition. In high-income countries, LPS are pushed toward more sutainable practices, whereas low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing fast intensification processes. Assessing the impact of such transitions requires an understanding of how they will affect the spatial distribution of livestock. This project builds on our extensive experience of mapping livestock distributions with two main objectives. First, based on the present-day situation in a range of countries along an intensification gradient, we aim to better understand the factors influencing the spatial distribution of farms and animals at multiple spatial scales. Second, based on the present and retrospective spatio-temporal livestock distribution models, we aim to project the future distribution of livestock according to the different “shared socioeconomic pathways” (SSPs), which are standardized scenarios of the future that have been developed in the context of climate change. Our main partner in this project is [Sophie Vanwambeke](http://www.elic.ucl.ac.be/modx/elic/index.php?id=108) from UCL.
