Louis joined SpELL in March 2019 as a research scientist to work on the MONODIS project. The project aims to map the distribution of the 
vectors of the pine pine wood nematode (PWN), *Bursaphelenchus xylophilus*, belonging to the genus *Monochamus* (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) 
at different spatial scale and extent in Europe, based on a extensive netowrk of trapping data.
