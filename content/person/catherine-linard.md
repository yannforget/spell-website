### Biographical sketch. 

Catherine Linard graduated in Geographical Sciences at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL, Belgium) in 2005. She completed her PhD thesis on spatial and integrated modelling of complex disease systems at the Department of Geography of the UCL in January 2009 and was then visiting researcher for 4 months at the Department of Zoology (TALA Research Group), University of Oxford. She was then a post-doctoral fellow of the Wiener-Anspach Foundation for two years at the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford, followed by four years (2011-2015) as post-doctoral fellow of the “Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique” (FNRS, Brussels, Belgium) at the ULB. She is now sharing her time between an half-time academic position at the department of Geography of the University of Namur and a half-time researcher position at the ULB.

### Research interests.  

Catherine is interested in the interactions between the different agents responsible for the transmission of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (humans, vectors, animal hosts and the environment). She combines different methods and tools – especially high resolution remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems, spatial statistics and multi-agent models – for an integrated approach to spatial issues in epidemiology. Her current research activities focus on urban expansion models for Africa, human population distribution forecasts and their impact on vector-borne diseases (P. falciparum malaria and dengue). She also produces and updates high-resolution population distribution maps for African countries (WorldPop project: www.worldpop.org.uk).
