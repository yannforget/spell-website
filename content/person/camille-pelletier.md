## Biographical sketch

Camille Pelletier is specialised in viral epidemiology and evolution, with a background in marine ecology and bioinformatics. She holds a master's degree in biological oceanography and marine ecology from Aix-Marseille University (2019). During her master's internship at Ifremer, she explored the evolution of the Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1), focusing on genetic exchanges with its host, the Pacific oyster *Magallana gigas*, through bioinformatics and omics approaches. 

In 2023, Camille completed her PhD at Ifremer, where she investigated the diversity and evolution of OsHV-1. Her research employed a multidisciplinary approach, integrating experimental infections, molecular biology, and advanced bioinformatics to trace the global evolutionary history of the virus and its spatial and temporal distribution across host species. She then joined the Institut Pasteur in Paris as a research engineer in 2024, expanding her expertise to respiratory RNA viruses and assisted three projects with bioinformatics support. Since 2025, Camille has been a postdoctoral researcher at Ifremer, under the supervision of [Maude Jacquot](https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/27588/) and co-supervision of [Simon Dellicour](https://spell.ulb.be/person/simon-dellicour/) at the SpELL, as part of the [IDEAL](https://asim.ifremer.fr/Projets/Projets-en-cours/IDEAL-2024-2027) project. She focuses on quantifying the role of genomic analyses in understanding the spread of marine pathogens and identifying key factors influencing their distribution. Specifically, Camille compares spatio-statistical and phylogeographical approaches to assess how these methodologies can identify and quantify the impact of environmental and biological factors on the spatial distribution and spread of marine pathogens.
