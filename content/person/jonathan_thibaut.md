## Biographical sketch

Jonathan holds a master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science from the UCLouvain, with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence. His research focuses on the analysis of epidemiological contact tracing data.

## Research interests

Jonathan started a PhD project in November 2022 at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology (KU Leuven) under the co-supervision of [Emmanuel André](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00121011) and [Guy Baele](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/GuyBaele.html) at the KU Leuven, as well as [Simon Dellicour](https://spell.ulb.be/person/simon-dellicour/) at the ULB. The goal of his project is to optimise the Test & Trace system with the use of bioinformatics and machine learning techniques. To do so, he develops plugins for the outbreak investigation tool Go.Data, which has been developed by the WHO.
