## Biographical sketch

After several years as a manager in the retail sector, Hélène wanted to change fields while remaining in a dynamic environment. So it was quite natural for her to apply to ULB in 2018, attracted by the stimulating environment that this university represents, as well as by the enriching interactions that it allows. She is responsible for helping our new students and researchers with their administrative formalities and acts as a mediator between the members of our team and the Central Administration departments (HRD, Finance, Insurance, etc). She also works for two other departments in the Faculty of Sciences.
