Yann Forget graduated in Geography and Geomatics at the University Toulouse II (France) in 2014, where he completed his MsC thesis on Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULC) modeling under the supervision of [Thomas Houet](https://perso.univ-rennes2.fr/en/thomas.houet). He joined the Spatial Epidemioly Lab in 2014 to work on his PhD thesis entitled *"Mapping 20 Years of Urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa from Space: An approach based on multi-sensor satellite imagery and volunteered geographic information"*, in the context of the [MAUPP](https://maupp.ulb.ac.be/) project and under the supervision of [Marius Gilbert](https://spell.ulb.be/person/marius-gilbert/). In 2018, he joined the [Signal Image Centre](http://www.sic.rma.ac.be/) of the Royal Military Academy of Brussels to work on the [GEPATAR](http://gepatar.kikirpa.be/about.html) project. He returned to SpELL in 2019 for two years as a Post-Doc to work on the GeoHealthAccess project.

# Research interests

Yann is interested in spatial issues in human and health geography, including land use and land cover changes, human population mapping, urbanization and health accessibility. He combines satellite remote sensing with spatial modeling to produce and analyze large-scaled geospatial datasets, allowing for a better understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics in health and human geography in a context of global change. He is particularly interested in the development of new methods that leverage the synergy between new open-access satellite catalogs and crowd-sourced geographic databases such as OpenStreetMap.
