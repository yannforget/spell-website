Kyla hold a masterâ€™s degree in Eco-epidemiology from the University of Montpellier, with a specialisation in parasitic and infectious disease management and surveillance. Kyla conducted her master thesis project at the SpeLL lab and investigated the role of climate change on the emergence of Chikungunya virus in Europe.
