## Bio
Jean is a post-doctoral researcher working on the MOOD project which aims to improve detection, monitoring, and assessment of diseases in Europe. His doctoral research focused on the spatial distribution of avian influenza in humans, poultry and wild birds. He developed spatial models within the context of recent epidemic and epizootic outbreaks to update knowledge about the origin of various avian influenza viruses. His research led him to develop spatial cross-validation procedures to train/validate species distribution models. His thesis has also enabled him to discuss the transfer of methods (i.e. species distribution modelling) and concepts from ecology to spatial epidemiology, with a particular emphasis on their possible limitations. Additional information about Jeanâ€™s work can be found on his [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Artois) account.
