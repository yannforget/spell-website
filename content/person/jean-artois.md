Jean joined the SpELL team in October 2014 as a Ph.D. student, looking at the spatial distribution of avian influenza in poultry. He tries to develop species distribution models within the context of the micro-parasite studies. His previous research experience include working in [community ecology of rodents and their pathogens in South East Asia](http://www.ceropath.org/) and in [tick-borne disease risk in southern Norway](http://www.elic.ucl.ac.be/modx/elic/index.php?id=371). Jean completed one M.Sc. in Parasite Ecology at the University of Montpellier, before going onto a second M.Sc. in geomatics engineering at the University of Rennes.
