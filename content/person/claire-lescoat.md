## Biographical sketch

Claire Lescoat graduated as a bioengineer from AgroParisTech (France) in 2018. For her master's thesis, she worked at Institut Pasteur Paris on the interest of polyunsaturated fatty acids for mycobacteria control. After two years as a bioinformatic engineer at the University of Bordeaux to gain expertise on omics data analysis, she completed a PhD at INRAE Clermont-Ferrand (France) on the genomic epidemiology of a pestivirus responsible for an endemic bovine disease (December 2021 - December 2024). In this role, she developed an NGS protocol to generate genomic data, which she then analyzed to reconstruct viral population dynamics and spatiotemporal spread using phylodynamics approaches. Interested in expanding her focus to spatial analyses for public health, she joined the SpELL in January 2025 as a postdoctoral research fellow on the [ImmuReach project](https://spell.ulb.be/page/projects/). The project explores the determinants of under-immunization in children to improve outreach to underserved communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
