## Biographical sketch

Bastien pursued a master's degree at the University of Mons (UMons) in biology of organisms and ecology. His master's thesis re-evaluated the status and trends of European pollinators, specifically the Osmiine bee (Megachilidae, tribe Osmiini) in the context of the European Red List of Bees. This, together with internships abroad at Lund University (Sweden) and the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History (Germany), led him to work on many aspects of biology, while deepening his interests in the field of conservation biology and wild bee ecology. Eager to pursue and reinforce his research interests, he started a PhD project at the SpELL, focusing on the impact of current climate change on bumblebees (genus *Bombus**), a group of cold-adapted and endangered pollinators, using phylodynamic and machine learning approaches.
