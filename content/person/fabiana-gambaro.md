## Biographical sketch

Fabiana studied for a master's degree in Molecular Biology at the University of the Republic, Uruguay (March 2016 - August 2018). For her master's dissertation, she worked at Institut Pasteur of Montevideo, and her research focused on small regulatory RNAs, extracellular vesicles, and their role in cell-to-cell communication. Then, viruses won her over. So, for her PhD, she moved on to work on the epidemiology and evolution of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Chikungunya virus at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, under the supervision of [Etienne Simon-Loriere](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/evolutionary-genomics-rna-viruses/) (October 2018 – June 2022). In particular, during her Ph.D., she used NGS technologies to generate virus genomic data, which she analysed to study intra-host viral diversity or reconstruct viral outbreak dynamics and spatiotemporal spread using phylodynamic approaches. In October 2022, Fabiana joined the Spatial Epidemiology Lab for her first post-doc, where she works on testing and applying new landscape phylogeographic techniques.

## Research interests

Fabiana’s research interests focus on investigating the epidemiology and evolution of RNA viruses and applying new phylodynamic approaches to understand how these processes interact. In particular, she is interested in using methods of spatiotemporal reconstruction of viral spread (landscape phylogeographic approaches) to understand the impact of environmental factors on the dispersal history and dynamic of viruses. Fabiana is also very interested in studying the evolution of RNA viruses operating at different scales: between and intra-host evolution.
