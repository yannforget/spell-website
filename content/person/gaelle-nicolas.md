Gaëlle Nicolas graduated in Animal health and epidemiology of tropical diseases at the Université de Montpellier 2 (UM2, France) in 2010. She completed her PhD thesis at the UM2 in December 2013 on the circulation of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) by cattle movement with a particular emphasis on the modelling of the viral spread in a temperate and mountainous ecosystem of the Madagascar highland. During her PhD, she spend 1.5 years  in Madagascar to collect field data. This was followed by 1 year in  ANSES (the french agency for food and safety) and CIRAD teams, to analyse these data and share competences. Since January 2014, she joined SpELL as a post-doctoral researcher funded by the "Mapping people and livestock" FNRS project.

## Research interests  
Through the understanding of social habits and local practices Gaëlle tries to study the impact of human and environmental factors on the emergence of infectious diseases, with a particular focus on the inter-species interface (Wildlife/Livestock/Human). With an epidemiological background rooted in the field, she combines different approaches such as satellite imagery, Geographical Information Systems, statistical and mechanistic modelling for an integrated approach of epidemiological problems. Her current research focus on the spatial epidemiology of animal disease, livestock mobility and spatial distribution mapping of livestock using information from agricultural censuses, geo-referenced data and remote-sensed imagery.  

## Ongoing research projects  

* [Mapping Livestock and Livestock](/project/mapping-people-and-livestock/) 
* Targetted surveillance of the emergence of bovine tuberculosis in Belgian wildlife (WILDTUB)
