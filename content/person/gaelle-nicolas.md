# Biographical sketch   
Gaëlle Nicolas graduated in Animal health and epidemiology of tropical diseases at the Université de Montpellier 2 (UM2, France) in 2010. She completed her PhD thesis at the UM2 in December 2013 on the Rift Valley fever circulation by cattle movement with a particular emphasis on the modelling of the viral spread in a temperate and mountainous ecosystem of the Madagascar highland. During this PhD she was based in Madagascar for 1.5 years to collect the useful study data and 1 year in each: ANSES (the french agency for food and safety) and CIRAD teams, to analyse these data and share competences. Since January 2014, she is post-doctoral researcher at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (Grants from the “Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique” (FNRS, Brussels, Belgium)).

# Research interests  
Through the understanding of social habits and local practices Gaëlle tries to estimate impact of Human and environmental factors on the emergence of infectious diseases with a particular focus at the inter-species interface (Wildlife/Livestock/Human). With an epidemiological background strongly related to field work, she combines different approaches as satellite imagery, Geographical Information Systems, statistical and mechanistic modelling for an integrated approach of epidemiological issues. Her current research focus on the spatial distribution mapping of livestock using information from agricultural censuses (combined with spatial high-resolution distribution mapping of people), geo-referenced data and remote-sensed imagery through the use of the programming language R.

# Current research project  
Mapping Livestock  
Targetted surveillance of the emergence of bovine tuberculosis in Belgian wildlife (WILDTUB)  
Emerging, Viral Vector-Borne Diseases (Vmerge): Rift Valley fever and Bluetongue virus spreading, livestock mobility
