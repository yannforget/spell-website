## Biographical sketch

Raphaël is a researcher at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environmnent (INRAE), and is currently visiting SpELL to collaborate with Simon Dellicour (ULB) and Philippe Lemey (Rega Institute, KU Leuven). He completed a PhD in mathematics at the centre of applied mathematics of the Ecole Polytechnique in 2017, and has since been working as an INRAE researcher at the BioSP research unit in Avignon. Raphaël works on spatial stochastic models in population genetics, evolutionary biology and spatial epidemic models, with a special interest for their underlying phylogenies. He is mainly interested in how populations and epidemics spread through heterogeneous physical and phenotypic spaces as a result of dispersal and/or adaptation and the traces left by these events in the genetic makeup of the population of interest.
