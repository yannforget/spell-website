## Research interests

Thom develops maps of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and explores economic incentives to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU) in animals. The work of his group aims to inform policy-makers, on a global level, to address the rise of drug-resistant pathogens in animals. His research areas include AMR epidemiology, disease mapping, and livestock production systems. Thom, and his group have initiated the development of a platform to centralize epidemiological data collection on AMR ([resistancebank.org](https://resistancebank.org/)). The list of publications below only includes his publication performed in collaboration with some SpELL members - for his full list of publications, see the [web page](https://thomasvanboeckel.wixsite.com/hegep) of his research group.
