## Biographical sketch

Hélène Duault studied for a master’s degree in epidemiological surveillance of human and animal diseases (September 2019 - June 2020) in her last year at the National Veterinary School of Alfort (France; September 2014 - September 2020). She recently obtained a PhD in public health at the Université Paris-Saclay (France) under the co-supervision of Dr Benoit Durand and Dr Laetitia Canini (Anses; October 2020 - October 2023). Her doctoral research focused on phylodynamic and transmission tree reconstruction of Mycobacterium bovis outbreaks within multi-host systems. In November 2023, she started a two-year postdoc in the UMR EPIA (“Epidémiologie des maladies animales et zoonotiques”) at the INRAE (“Institut National de Recherche pour l’Agriculture, l’Alimentation et l’Environnement"), under the supervision of Dr Guillaume Fournié. This postdoc will involve the development of mechanistic models to study the transmission dynamics of pathogens (in particular avian influenza viruses) along animal contact networks.
