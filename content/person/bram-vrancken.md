## Biographical sketch

His research interest lies in using evolutionary approaches to better understand how viruses (and more generally, pathogens) can persist. This curiosity is fundamentally driven by the contention that emperical knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie sustained spread should be a fundamental building block of public health decision making. This covers the continuum from within-host replication (e.g. How do viruses cope with the selective pressure imposed by the host immune system, which relates to for example vaccine development?) over how epidemics ignite (e.g. What does it take to start a pandemic? What circumstances and/or combination of characteristics make a cross-species transmission event more or less likely to lead to sustained transmission in the new host?), to identifying the migration routes (geographic, between risk groups, etc) by which viruses manage to on average infect more than one person...
