## Biographical sketch

Darlan is a Research Associate in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London and a Scientific Collaborator at the SpELL. His research focuses on using epidemiological and genomic data to understand virus spread, transmission and evolution. Currently, his work is developed in the Vaccine Epidemiology Research Group, under the co-supervision of Dr Isobel Blake and Prof Nick Grassly, applying mathematical models and phylogenetic tools to explore the dynamics of spread of vaccine-derived polio virus in African countries.

Darlan hold a Bachelor’s in Pharmacy from the Federal University of Ceará and a Master’s in Allergy and Immunopathology from the University of São Paulo. In 2022, he was awarded a PhD in Zoology from the University of Oxford following his work on the epidemiology and genomics of arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and other Latin American countries. His PhD research was developed within the scope of the Brazil-UK Centre for Arbovirus Discovery, Diagnosis, Genomics and Epidemiology (CADDE) and explored the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and its evolution, including the identification, reporting and description of the P.1/Gamma variant of concern in Manaus in January 2021. He also investigated the within-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2 in São Paulo using both epidemiological and genomic data from patients and healthcare workers

## Research interests

Darlan is broadly interested in the application of genomic epidemiology approaches to uncover spatiotemporal dynamics and drivers of RNA virus spread during outbreaks. More specifically, he is interested in bridging the gap between genomic epidemiology approaches and public health impact, moving from descriptive analysis to understanding and informing interventions.
