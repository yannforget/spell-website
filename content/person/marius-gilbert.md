Marius Gilbert graduated in Agricultural Sciences at the University of Brussels (ULB) in 1995. He was then a visiting researcher for two years at the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford and obtained a PhD on the spatial epidemiology of a forest insect pest at ULB in 2001. In 2006, he was awarded a permanent academic position with the Belgian FNRS, and joined the university as professor in 2023. In 2016, he founded the Spatial Epidemiology Lab (SpELL), now led by Simon Dellicour. During the COVID pandemic, he joined the Expert Group on the Exit Strategy (GEES) that was assembled by the prime minister Sophie Wilmes to advise the government on the lockdown exit strategy. In September 2020 he joined the team of the rector Annemie Schaus as vice-rector of Research and Valorization, during her first mandate, and with an additional mandate of Vice-rector of Culture and Scientific mediation in the current one.

## Research interest

Marius has broad interests in the spatial epidemiology of animal diseases and invasive species. An overarching theme is the attempt to better understand how changes in agriculture and ecosystems have affected the conditions of emergence, spread and persistence of pathogens, including those with pandemic potential. His main area of expertise includes the epidemiology of avian influenza, emerging infectious diseases, global changes in livestock production systems, and livestock distribution models.

## Science communication

Marius played a key role in the french-speaking national media during the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous interventions throughout the pandemic. In September 2020, he published "Juste un passage au JT (Luc Pire)", which aimed to popularize the science behind the pandemic with the public and to share the experience of a scientist' journey at the nexus of political decision and communication in the media. He's now a regular columnist at the national journal Le Soir around the theme of science and society, and all these contributions can be found [here](https://www.lesoir.be/358546/dpi-authors/marius-gilbert).
