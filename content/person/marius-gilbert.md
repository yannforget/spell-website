Marius Gilbert graduated in Agricultural Sciences at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in 1995. He was then a visiting researcher for two years at the department of Zoology, University of Oxford and obtained a PhD on the spatial epidemiology of a forest insect pest at ULB in 2001. In 2006, he was awarded a permanent academic position with the Belgian FNRS. In 2016, he founded the Spatial Epidemiology Lab (SpELL) that he now leads as F.R.S.-FNRS research director. During the COVID pandemic, he joined the Expert Group on the Exit Strategy (GEES) that was assembled by the prime minister Sophie Wilmes to advise the government on the lockdown exit strategy. In september 2020 he joined the team of the rector Annemie Schaus as vice-rector of resarch and valorization. 

## Research interest

Marius has broad interests in the spatial epidemiology of animal diseases and invasive species. An overarching theme is the attempt to better understand how changes in agriculture and ecosystems have affected the conditions of emergence, spread and persistence of pathogens, including those with pandemic potential. His main area of expertise includes the epidemiology of avian influenza, emerging infectious diseases, global changes in livestock production systems, and livestock distribution models.

## Science communication

Marius played an key role in the french-speaking national media during the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous interventions throughout the pandemic. In September 2020, he published ["Juste un passage au JT (Luc Pire)"](https://www.amazon.fr/Juste-passage-au-Marius-Gilbert/dp/2875422464), which aimed to popularize the science behind the pandemic with the public and to share the experience of a scientist' journey at the nexus of political decision and communication in the media.
