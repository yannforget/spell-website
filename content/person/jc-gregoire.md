## Biographical sketch

Jean-Claude graduated in Agricultural sciences and Forestry at the (at the time) Faculté des Sciences agronomiques de Gembloux, and his PhD at ULB was in forest entomology. He was a research associate at F.R.S. -  FNRS, then became a professor at ULB. He is now retired but keeps a few things going on.


## Research interest

**My main field of interest is the ecology**, behaviour and control of forest insects. I am particularly interested in their reproductive strategies, natural enemies, relationships to their hosts, and spread. After decades of research, I must conclude that I have probably been ill advised to focus on particular scolytine species, sometimes awfully difficult to rear in the laboratory, instead of concentrating on particular problems to be tackled with easily cultured model species. But, nevertheless, the species I chose to study still fascinate me, as they are exemplary of fully divergent ecological strategies.

A first pet species, *Dendroctonus micans* (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a “parasite” of spruce, whose females are usually fertilized by a brother and establish solitarily of healthy trees, which they do not kill and in which they are protected by the tree chemical and physical defenses against competitors and generalist natural enemies. *D. micans* is however usually fairly well controlled by a very specific predator, the Monotomid beetle *Rhizophagus grandis*, and we have actually mass-produced these predators during several decades and released them throughout France with perfect control success. We also have brought a batch of Belgian predators to the UK in the early eighties, in order for the British Forestry Commission to start its own rearing programme.

A second scolytine species of choice, *Ips typographus*, is the most damaging forest pest in Europe. It kills millions of spruces yearly. It has the fascinating property to be able to shift from a scavenging state, at low population density to a predatory regime, when it kills trees. In both states, the insects behave collectively: they forage for scarce, unpredictable resource, and/or mass-attack standing trees. In both cases, their success depends upon a "reservoir" of conspecifics prompt to join the lucky individuals (males) that have found a suitable host and emit pheromones to attract females. At the limits of the range, the "reservoir" is not dense enough to allow aggressive tree killing but, following storms of dry and hot years, the reservoir can expand over large areas. Presently, for example it is suspected that beetles from Belgium and France, which are regularly trapped along the English Channel, tens of kilometers far from the spruce areas in both countries, flew over the Channel and established (hopefully temporary) bridgeheads in Southern England. Joint research with Forest Research (UK) is ongoing.

I also studied several other beetle species, not all of them Scolytinae: *Dendroctonus valens* in North America and in China, *D. punctatus* in Canada and Alaska, *Monochamus* spp. (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), *Thanasimus formicarius* (Coleoptera, Cleridae). Recent activities in the lab, in collaboration with Claude Bragard (UCLouvain), also include the distribution in Belgium and dispersal capacities of Hemipteran vectors, or potential vectors, of the bacterium *Xylella fastidiosa*, and their capacity to transmit the pathogen.

**A second field of interest for me is pest risk assessment**. I am currently involved in risk assessments for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Earlier on, I also worked as an expert for the Belgian National Plant Protection Organization, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) and for ANSES (FR).


## Projects

#### **Scolibe: risk analysis of harmful bark and ambrosia beetles in the Belgian context (2022-25)**
*Funded by the Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment*. Main partners: Jochem Bonte at ILVO; Louis Hautier, Gilles San Martin and Alex Kuhn at CRA-W.

Some of the major forest pests in the world are bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae). Many of them are expanding their territorial range and threatening new areas, including Belgium. The project addresses these threats, with several components: 1) Identification of species posing the highest risk for Belgium; 2) status of selected species in Belgium; 3) monitoring for prevention and early detection; 4) know-how, networking and toolbox for (rapid) identification; 5) guidelines for control measures.

#### **Ribsurx: design of a statistically sound and risk-based survey plan for the detection of Xylella fastidiosa in Belgium (2022-23)**
*Funded by Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment*. Main partner: Claude Bragard at Earth and Life Institute, UCLouvain; Jolien Venneman at ILVO.

This project follows and completes previous research in Belgium, with the objective of providing practical tools to risk managers. It will define and map different types of vegetation coverages where X. fastidiosa could establish, rank them according to establishment likeliness and potential impact if contaminated, and propose adapted sampling procedures for both detection and containment.

#### **Research within the framework of the Walloon Observatory of Forest Health (Annual funding, ongoing)**
*Funded by the Walloon Region*. Main partners: Quentin Leroy at OWSF; Louis Hautier, Gilles San Martin, Alex Kuhn and Anne Chandelierat CRA-W.

Scientific support to the activities of the Observatoire wallon de la Santé des Forêts (OWSF).

#### **Agritrap: developing a monitoring capacity for native and exotic *Agrilus* spp. in Belgium (2021-23, completed)**
*Funded by the Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment*. Main partners: Jochem Bonte at ILVO; Louis Hautier, Gilles San Martin and Alex Kuhn at CRA-W; Tim Belien at PCFruit.

The project aims to consolidate the European studies conducted so far, and, with collaboration from European and North American researchers within the more global Euphresco project [Developing and assessing surveillance methodologies for *Agrilus* beetles](https://zenodo.org/record/4672531#.Y15McIKZMqs), Its aim is to devise a generic trapping technique for *Agrilus* spp. (Coleoptera, Buprestidae). The project is also expected to contribute to the development of monitoring tools for specific American and European *Agrilus* species.

### Developing the Fan-trap

Monitoring is an important component of pest management, to prevent or mitigate outbreaks of native pests, and to check for quarantine organisms. Surveys often rely on trapping, especially when the target species respond to semiochemicals. Many traps are available for this purpose, but they are bulky in most cases, which raises transportation and deployment issues, and they are expensive, which limits the size and accuracy of any network. To overpass these difficulties, en-tomologists have used recycled material, such as modified plastic bottles, producing cheap and reliable traps but at the cost of recurrent handywork, not necessarily possible for all end-users (e.g., for national plant protection organizations). These bottle-traps have allowed very large sur-veys which would have been impossible with standard commercial traps, and we illustrate this approach with a few examples. Here we present, under a Creative Commons BY-SA License, the blueprint of a fan-trap, a foldable model, laser-cut from a sheet of polypropylene, that can rapidly be pro-duced in large numbers, and could be transported and deployed in the field with very little ef-forts. Our first field comparisons show that fan-traps are as efficient as bottle-traps, and we de-scribe two cases where they are being used for monitoring.
