## Profile
Maude has broad interests in molecular epidemiology and pathogen evolution, phylogeography, spatial and landscape genetics, and disease ecology. 

Her research mainly focuses on Lyme disease and Bluetongue that are both caused by vector-borne pathogens. She studies evolutionary and epidemiological processes that shape bacterial and/or viral genetic diversity, spanning from studying small-scale transmissions dynamics and within host and vector evolutionary processes (reassortment, recombination and adaptation) to investigating large-scale processes such as spatial dispersal (phylogeography and phylodynamics).
