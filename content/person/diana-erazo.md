## Biographical sketch

Diana Erazo is an environmental engineer interested in the effects of environmental change in infectious disease dynamics. During her PhD at the University of Los Andes (Colombia, 2018), she studied the impacts of oil palm plantations in the parasite transmission of Chagas disease. Afterwards, she did a one-year post-doc in the Vignuzzi lab at Institut Pasteur (2018-2019) and a second post-doc in the group of Andy Fenton at the University of Liverpool (2019-2021). She joined SpELL in June 2021 to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of rodent borne diseases in Western Europe. Her work will throw light on the future of rodent-borne disease transmission dynamics under future climate conditions and human mobility.
