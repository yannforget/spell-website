## Biographical sketch

Diana Erazo is an environmental engineer interested in the effects of environmental change in infectious disease dynamics. During her PhD at the University of Los Andes (Colombia, 2018), she studied the impacts of oil palm plantations in the parasite transmission of Chagas disease. Afterwards, she did a one-year post-doc in the Vignuzzi lab at Institut Pasteur (2018-2019) and a second post-doc in the group of Andy Fenton at the University of Liverpool (2019-2021). She joined SpELL in June 2021 to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of rodent borne diseases in Western Europe. Diana currently holds a postdoctoral researcher fellowship awarded by the Belgian Fonds National pour la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) to uncover the historical and future impact of anthropogenic climate change and other human drivers on arbovirus spread in Europe. To this end, she is developing and applying an analytical framework at the interface between spatial epidemiology and climate science.
