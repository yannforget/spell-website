## Biographical sketch

Nena Bollen holds a master's degree in bio-statistics from the KULeuven. Her interest in public health was sparked (a bit unconventionally) during her bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology, where she became fascinated by how social factors can influence health on a population level. This interest has grown from social epidemiology to epidemiology in general, finding a niche in the study of infectious diseases. Her field of study lies in estimating viral spread using phylogeographic models. She also has a fondness for data visualisation projects.

## PhD project

In 2020, Nena started a PhD co-supervised by [Guy Baele](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/staff-members/00075702) at the Evolutionary and Computational Virology Lab (KU Leuven) and [Simon Dellicour](https://spell.ulb.be/person/simon-dellicour/) at the Spatial Epidemiology Lab (ULB).
