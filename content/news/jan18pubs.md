title: "Recent papers discuss the interplay between agricultural intensification and avian influenza in Asia"
---

Two papers were recently published on this topic from different perspectives. 

In the paper [Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China: a ‘One Health/Ecohealth’ epitome](https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-017-0218-4), we discussed different sets of ecological and epidemiological pressures that could have lead to the emergence of avian influenza in Asia.

In the paper [Could Changes in the Agricultural Landscape of Northeastern China Have Influenced the Long-Distance Transmission of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5Nx Viruses?](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2017.00225/full), we present recent evidences of massive land-use change in northeastern China and discuss how these could have influenced the long-distance transmission of avian influenza viruses.
