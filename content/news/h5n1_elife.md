title: "New papers in e-life on H5N1"
---
A new paper has just been published in e-life mapping the global distribution of areas where HPAI H5N1 would have a high chance of sustained transmission upon introduction, as illustrated in the figure below.

This was our first experience with e-life and we really enjoyed the quality and transparency of the peer-reviewing process, where referee comments are summarized and consolidated by the editorial team, and published, with their responses alonside the paper. The paper is available in open access here:

The paper also introduces spatial cross-validation techniques that are shown to be particularly important to quantify the goodness of fit of spatial machine-learning models, as compared to standard cross-validations.
