title: "A new paper in Science on antimicrobial resistance in low and middle countries"
---

The paper aimed to produce a first global overview of antimicrobial resistance in low and middle-income countries, based 
on the compilation of thousands of point-prevalence surveys. The paper, published in 
[Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6459/eaaw1944) describes temporal trends in the levels of resistance
in farm animals, and provides a first global map of where antimicrobial resistance is the highest. 

The paper is lead by Thomas Van Boeckel, a 
former member of the lab, who now leads the [Health Geography and Policy Group](https://thomasvanboeckel.wixsite.com/hegep)
at ETH Zurich, and was carried out in collaboration with researchers from Princeton university and CDDEP.

The publication of the paper is also an opportunity to launch the platform [https://resistancebank.org](https://resistancebank.org)for the collection and sharing of data on 
antimicrobial resistance that are produced worldwide.
