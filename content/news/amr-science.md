title: "A new paper in Science on antimicrobial consumption in food animals"
---

In this paper, published in Science today, we conducted a first global assessment of different intervention 
policies that could help limit the projected increase of antimicrobial use in food production.

The paper is lead by 
It was found that worldwide antimicrobial consumption is expected to rise by a staggering 52% and reach 200,000 tonnes in 2030 barring any actions. This is an alarming revision from already pessimistic estimates that we contributed to produce in 2010, pushed up mostly by recent reports of high antimicrobial use in animals in China. 

Compared to a business as usual scenario, a global regulation putting a cap of 50 mg of antimicrobials per kilogram of animal per year in OECD countries could reduce global consumption by 60% without affecting livestock-related economic development in low-income countries. However such a policy may be challenging to enforce in resource-limited settings. An alternative solution could be to impose a user fee of 50% of the current price on veterinary antimicrobials: this could reduce global consumption by 31% and generate yearly revenues of between US$ 1.7 and 4.6 billion. 

An important limiting factor in performing this global assessment was accessing sufficient data on veterinary antimicrobial sales volumes and prices. The present study is based on publicly available data, limited to 37 countries. Representatives from the animal health industry were approach for this study but all declined to share information on antimicrobial sales or prices.  

The research was conducted by Van Boeckel and Bonhoeffer, respectively postdoctoral fellow and professor at the Institute of Integrative Biology of the ETH Zurich; Gilbert from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB); Robinson from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; Grenfell and Levin professors at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton; Glennon, Chen and Laxminarayan, respectively scholars and director at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, Washington, D.C. The research conducted at ETH was funded by the program for Adaptation to a Changing Environment, the ETH postdoctoral fellowship program and the European Research Council.
