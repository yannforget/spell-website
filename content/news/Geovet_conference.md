Four members of the lab will be attending the Geovet conferences in November, with talks on the spread of Bluetonge (G. Nicolas), on large-scale suitability models for HPAI H5N1 viruses (J. Artois), on farm distribution models (C. Chaiban) and status of the gridded livestock of the world database ([M. Gilbert](/persons/mgilbert)). Looking forward to a great meeting !
