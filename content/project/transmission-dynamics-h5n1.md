Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype continues to persists in a number of countries in Asia and Africa, and remains a major public health concern. Rapidly changing agricultural intensification, landscapes and markets over the past few decades have resulted in significant changes in the size and spatial distribution of poultry and pig farms as well as their connectivity between farms, which affect the dynamics and spillover of avian influenza at the human- animal interface. 

This project aimed to develop and integrate mathematic, statistical and agent-based models to predict the potential dynamics and spillover of avian influenza at the human-animal interface and to evaluate the effects of various control measures on avian influenza virus transmission and spread.

The project was build around three main types of activities. First, we aimed to create a series of new data sets describing the poultry host distribution, the environment and wild bird movements. Second, we aimed to integrate these data to improve our understanding of avian inlfuenza at multiple spatial scale and to integrate them at multiple spatial scales. Third, we aimed to use mathematical modelling to predict the potential spread and spillover of HPAI H5N1 in different countries.
