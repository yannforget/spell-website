## PALE-Blu: Understanding pathogen, livestock, environment interactions involving bluetongue virus (2017-2020)
*Funded by EU H2020*

New outbreaks caused by bluetongue viruses (BTVs) have emerged in European livestock every year since 1998. These events that have been linked to climate change, resulted in massive losses due to fatalities, reduced productivity, reproductive failures, restricted animal movements/trade, and surveillance/vaccination costs. PALE-Blu brings together European institutes with expertise in BTV research and diagnosis, with partners in endemic regions (Africa, the Middle East and Turkey) that act as a ‘source’ for BTV strains that emerge in Europe. Our role in the project it to lead the spatial modelling work package, which aims to better understand how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence the spread of the disease, using spatial modelling and landscape phylogenetic approaches.

## Mapping the transition toward more sustainable livestock production systems (2017-2021)
*Funded by FNRS PDR-WISD*

Many livestock production systems (LPS) are in a state of transition. In high-income countries, LPS are pushed toward more sutainable practices, whereas low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing fast intensification processes. Assessing the impact of such transitions requires an understanding of how they will affect the spatial distribution of livestock. This project builds on our extensive experience of mapping livestock distributions with two main objectives. First, based on the present-day situation in a range of countries along an intensification gradient, we aim to better understand the factors influencing the spatial distribution of farms and animals at multiple spatial scales. Second, based on the present and retrospective spatio-temporal livestock distribution models, we aim to project the future distribution of livestock according to the different “shared socioeconomic pathways” (SSPs), which are standardized scenarios of the future that have been developed in the context of climate change. Our main partner in this project is [Sophie Vanwambeke](http://www.elic.ucl.ac.be/modx/elic/index.php?id=108) from UCL
