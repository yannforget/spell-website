title: Livestock diseases
summary: "We have primarily been working on a better understanding of the geography of avian influenza (AI H5N1, H7N9) with particular emphasison the role of agro-ecological factors. Over the years, we have also been involved in research on  other diseases of livestock,  including bovine tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease, bluetongue, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, and Nipah virus infections."

The largest body of our research has dealt with avian influenza ("bird flu") in Asia. We have also been studying the spatial epidemiology of various livestock diseases at both  local and continental scales to better understand their spatial distribtution and to identify their main spatial drivers, as illustrated below.

## Avian influenza (H5N1, H7N9)

### Background

In 2004, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus started spreading throughout Asia, causing the death of millions of poultry, and transmitting occasionaly to humans, with some fatalities. In the following years, the virus spread across Eurasia down to Africa. Today, it persist in a limited set of countries (Egypt, Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, Indonesia). Our work consisted in identifying the main risk factors associated with the presence or absence of the diseases at multiple scale, in particular the role of host species, and type of farming. Recently, a different avian influenza H7N9 virus emerged in China, low pathogenic in poultry this time, but causing human fatalities too. 

### Ongoing work

Our current research aims to understand the agro-ecological drivers of  avian influenza emergence. Why are these viruses emerging ? Where are they more likely to emerge ? Why are they showing a higher apparent seasonality ? What is the respective role of wild bird connectivity and trade in pattern of virus migrations ? There is a number of question we are trying to tackle through geospatial analysis and modelling.

### Perspectives

In the long run, we aim to better understand the role of changes in production and trade systems in the emergence and spread of those viruses, so that we can project how changes in those systems resulting from intensification of the production may translate into disease risk.

### Collaborations

Our main institutional collaborators are or have been T. Robinson (International Livestock Research Institute, ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya), S. Newman, V. Martin, J. Slingenbergh (Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, Rome, Italy), W. Thanapongtharm (Department of Livestock Development, DLD, Bangkok, Thailand), H. Yu (Chinese Center for Disease Control, CDC, Beijing, China), and our main academic collaborators are or have been Xiangming Xiao (Univ. Oklahoma, USA), Julien Cappelle (CIRAD, Montpellier, France), D. Pfeiffer (Royal Veterinary College, London, UK), N. Golding & S. Hay (SEEG, Univ. Oxford, Oxford, UK).


### Other livestock diseases

Previous work has involved studies on bovine tuberculosis in Belgium and in the UK, and on the vectors of Bluetongue disease in Belgium and Italy. We currently work on applying spatial modelling to different disease such Bluetongue in Europe, and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and Nipah virus infections in Thailand.
