title: Mapping livestock
summary: "The geographical distribution of livestock (cattle, sheep, goat, pig, chicken, duck, buffaloes, camels) is a key driver of the distribution of diseases and has important environmental impacts at a global scale in terms of direct pollution through manure managment, greenhouse gaz emissions and contribution to antimicrobial resistance. Our work aim to better map the distribution of livestock production at a global scale, with some special emphasis on intensive livestock production and projections."

### Background

For many years, several research groups and international organisations have developed high-resolution global maps of livestock based on reported statistics derived from census and survey data. Due to the dynamic nature of these populations (intensification of livestock production) this is an extremely challenging task that involves the collection of contemporary statistics, the development of complex algorithms to disaggregate these statistics at higher spatial resolutions and make predictions where they are absent.

### Ongoing work

The main objectives of our ongoing work are to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the different approaches that are used to predict and represent livestock distribution in high-resolution global databases. Our initial efforts focused on the establishment of global livestock distribution data representing the best data available to date (Gilbert *et al*. 2018). 

We now work on the development of time series for the past (1990 - present) and for the future (present - 2050) based on time series of predictor variables and on adapted modelling procedures that can take advantages of training data in space and time. 

In parrallel, we also worked on the development of different models that are better suited to predict monogastric species (poultry and pigs) that can be raised in very high number within a single locations. We investigated the use of point-pattern simulation modelling to predict farm locations (Chaiban *et al*. 2019) and ocne calibrated, the approach will be applied to create realistic synthetic farm distribution models in relevant countries. 

### Perspectives

Further developments involve predicting how intensification of the livestock production sector may impact the geoghraphical distribution of animals and farms in ruminant and monogastric livestock production systems. We also work toward the development of animal movement models (Nicolas *et al*. 2018) that can be used to predict movement networks. 

### Dissemination

Our work is carried out in collaboration with the FAO Livestock and Environment group, and is presented in [FAO Livestock  Systems](http://www.fao.org/livestock-systems/en/) web page. The data themselves are distributed through the [Global Livestock Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gld) Harvard dataverse.
