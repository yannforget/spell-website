title: Mapping human population
summary: "For many low-income countries of the World where disease burden is greatest, spatially detailed, contemporary census data on human population are missing. As partner of the Worldpop consortiumn, we are working on improving human population distribution maps in Africa and on urban expansion model that would allow us to project how the distribution of human population may change over time."

### Background

Among the agents involved in the disease transmission process, human hosts play a crucial role as their density, spatial location, demographic characteristics (e.g. age-risk profiles) and behaviour determine their exposure to infection. Any approach that requires the use of modelled disease rates or dynamics requires reasonable information on the resident human population for the time period one is intending to estimate risk. Where risks and spread of diseases are heterogeneous in space, population distributions and counts should ideally be resolved to higher levels of spatial detail than large regional estimates. Accurate and detailed information on population size and distribution are therefore of significant importance for deriving populations at risk and infection movement estimates in spatial epidemiological studies. For many low-income countries of the World, where disease burden is greatest, however, spatially detailed, contemporary census data do not exist. This is especially true for much of Africa, where currently available census data are often over a decade old, and at administrative boundary levels just below national-level.

### Ongoing work

We contributed to recent developments of the WorldPop database (www.worldpop.org.uk), more specifically on the AfriPop part of the project (see the map below from Linard et al. 2012) The WorlPop project aims to provide an open access archive of spatial demographic datasets for Africa, Asia and Central and South America to support development and health applications. The methods used are designed with full open access and operational application in mind, using transparent, fully documented and shareable methods to produce easily updatable maps with accompanying metadata. Current work also includes the development of continental-scale urban expansion models for Africa in order to produce predicted human population distribution datasets for 2020 and 2030.

### Perspectives

We aim to work on further improvements of the population distribution models by (i) improving population disaggregation algorithms and predictor variables included in the modelling process, (ii) including urban expansion forecasts into predicted population distribution datasets and (iii) evaluate the potential of the wealth of spatio-temporal data provided by new technologies (mobile phones and social networks such as Twitter) to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of human population distribution datasets.

### WorldPop Dissemination

Dissemination is ensured throuhg the Worldpop database where the data can be visualised and downloaded.
