title: Landscape phylogeography
summary: "Spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses can be used to introduce phylogenetic trees in a geographic context. Over the last years, we started exploiting such spatially-annotated trees to investigate the impact on environmental factors on the dispersal history and dynamic of viral lineages (dispersal velocity, dispersal direction and dispersal frequency). Furthermore, we also aim to use phylogeographic reconstruction to assess hypothetical intervention strategies in the context of viral epidemics.

### Background

Recent advances in genomics, mathematical modelling and computational biology have enabled evolutionary approaches to become a key component in studying of viral infectious diseases. The use of evolutionary approaches offers many advantages compared to traditional epidemiological methods; for example, they can reconstruct the demographic history of an entire epidemic even when surveillance data are sparse or non-existent, they require only a small number of sampled pathogens, and they can detect linkages among infections in time and space that may not be evident otherwise. Even over short time scales, viruses can accumulate significant diversity, resulting a genomic imprint of the ecological impact on transmission dynamics. By statistically analysing the genetic differences among viruses sampled from a population, we can reveal the underlying processes that govern viral transmission. Yet, a major challenge in this field is to develop methodologies to formally test the effect of environmental factors on pathogen transmission and evolution.

### Ongoing work

We are currently developing tools in landscape phylogeography, a field at the interface between spatial and molecular epidemiology and that aims to relate phylogenetic informed movements to external/environmental factors. Specifically, we focus on new methods to investigate the impact of environmental factors on the dispersal history and dynamic of viral lineages (dispersal velocity, dispersal direction and dispersal frequency), as well as to assess potential intervention strategies in the context of viral epidemics. Besides methodological developments, we also apply new and existing methodologies to study several virus spreads in their environmental context: rabies virus in Asia, bluetongue virus in Europe, West Nile virus in North America, Lassa virus in Africa, and African swine virus in Belgium.

### Collaborations

Our current research activities on this topic are performed in collaboration with the Evolutionary and Computational Virology lab of Philippe Lemey (KU Leuven) and the research team of Oliver Pybus (Department of Zoology, University of Oxford). We also have ongoing collaborations with the labs of Kristian Andersen at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, Roman Biek at the University of Glasgow, and Herv√© Bourhy at the Pasteur Institute of Paris.
