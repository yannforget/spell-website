abstract: 'Large scale, high-resolution global data on farm animal distributions are
  essential for spatially explicit assessments of the epidemiological, environmental
  and socio-economic impacts of the livestock sector. This has been the major motivation
  behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which
  has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies
  on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative
  units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of
  spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing,
  improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell
  (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology,
  however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale
  census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main
  factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and
  chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF)
  instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted
  the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled
  estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals
  per km 2 ). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified
  regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute
  density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different
  technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining
  their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology
  with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will
  need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural
  populations.'
