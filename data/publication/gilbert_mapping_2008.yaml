abstract: 'The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus that emerged in
  southern China in the mid-1990s has in recent years evolved into the first HPAI
  panzootic. In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully
  controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant
  control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing
  reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing
  ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such
  risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition,
  recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity
  obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical
  association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key
  environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers,
  duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in
  Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated
  with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to
  a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based
  on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive
  power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries
  with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model''s potential
  application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.'
