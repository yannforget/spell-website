abstract: 'The rapid transformation of the livestock sector in recent decades brought
  concerns on its impact on greenhouse gas emissions, disruptions to nitrogen and
  phosphorous cycles and on land use change, particularly deforestation for production
  of feed crops. Animal and human health are increasingly interlinked through emerging
  infectious diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance. In many developing
  countries, the rapidity of change has also had social impacts with increased risk
  of marginalisation of smallholder farmers. However, both the impacts and benefits
  of livestock farming often differ between extensive (backyard farming mostly for
  home-consumption) and intensive, commercial production systems (larger herd or flock
  size, higher investments in inputs, a tendency towards market-orientation). A density
  of 10,000 chickens per km 2  has different environmental, epidemiological and societal
  implications if these birds are raised by 1,000 individual households or in a single
  industrial unit. Here, we introduce a novel relationship that links the national
  proportion of extensively raised animals to the gross domestic product (GDP) per
  capita (in purchasing power parity). This relationship is modelled and used together
  with the global distribution of rural population to disaggregate existing 10 km
  resolution global maps of chicken and pig distributions into extensive and intensive
  systems. Our results highlight countries and regions where extensive and intensive
  chicken and pig production systems are most important. We discuss the sources of
  uncertainties, the modelling assumptions and ways in which this approach could be
  developed to forecast future trajectories of intensification.'
