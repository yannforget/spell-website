abstract: 'In India, majority outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
  H5N1 have occurred in eastern states of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. This study
  aimed to identify disease clusters and risk factors of HPAI H5N1 in these states,
  for targeted surveillance and disease control. A spatial scan statistic identified
  two significant disease clusters in West Bengal and Assam, occurring during January
  and Novemberâ€“December 2008, respectively. Key risk factors were identified at sub-district
  level using bootstrapped logistic regression and boosted regression trees model.
  With both methods, HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in backyard poultry were associated with
  accessibility in terms of time taken to access a city with \&gt;50,000 persons,
  human population density and duck density (P \&lt; 0.005). In addition, areas at
  lower elevation were also identified as high risk by BRT model. It is recommended
  that risk-based surveillance should be implemented in high duck density areas and
  all live-bird markets in high-throughput locations.'
