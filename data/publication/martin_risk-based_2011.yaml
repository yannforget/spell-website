abstract: 'Over the past two decades, the poultry sector in China went through a phase
  of tremendous growth as well as rapid intensification and concentration. Highly
  pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996
  in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early
  2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale
  preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out.
  This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks
  during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly
  isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist,
  which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social
  network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China
  has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in
  the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading
  patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining
  HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated
  risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights
  into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our
  study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning,
  daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV
  H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study
  also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of
  HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the
  counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used
  to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.'
