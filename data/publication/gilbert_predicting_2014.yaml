abstract: 'Two epidemic waves of an avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have so far affected
  China. Most human cases have been attributable to poultry exposure at live-poultry
  markets, where most positive isolates were sampled. The potential geographic extent
  of potential re-emerging epidemics is unknown, as are the factors associated with
  it. Using newly assembled data sets of the locations of 8,943 live-poultry markets
  in China and maps of environmental correlates, we develop a statistical model that
  accurately predicts the risk of H7N9 market infection across Asia. Local density
  of live-poultry markets is the most important predictor of H7N9 infection risk in
  markets, underscoring their key role in the spatial epidemiology of H7N9, alongside
  other poultry, land cover and anthropogenic predictor variables. Identification
  of areas in Asia with high suitability for H7N9 infection enhances our capacity
  to target biosurveillance and control, helping to restrict the spread of this important
  disease.'
