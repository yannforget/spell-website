abstract: 'Free-grazing ducks in rice paddies are a critical factor in the spread
  and persistence of avian influenza., Thailand has recently had 3 epidemic waves
  of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI); virus was again detected in July 2005.
  Risk factors need to be identified to better understand disease ecology and assist
  HPAI surveillance and detection. This study analyzed the spatial distribution of
  HPAI outbreaks in relation to poultry, land use, and other anthropogenic variables
  from the start of the second epidemic wave (July 2004â€“May 2005). Results demonstrate
  a strong association between H5N1 virus in Thailand and abundance of free-grazing
  ducks and, to a lesser extent, native chickens, cocks, wetlands, and humans. Wetlands
  used for double-crop rice production, where free-grazing duck feed year round in
  rice paddies, appear to be a critical factor in HPAI persistence and spread. This
  finding could be important for other duck-producing regions in eastern and southeastern
  Asian countries affected by HPAI.'
