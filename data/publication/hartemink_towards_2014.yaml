abstract: 'Given the veterinary and public health impact of vector-borne diseases,
  there is a clear need to assess the suitability of landscapes for the emergence
  and spread of these diseases. Current approaches for predicting disease risks neglect
  key features of the landscape as components of the functional habitat of vectors
  or hosts, and hence of the pathogen. Empiricalâ€“statistical methods do not explicitly
  incorporate biological mechanisms, whereas current mechanistic models are rarely
  spatially explicit; both methods ignore the way animals use the landscape (i.e.
  movement ecology). We argue that applying a functional concept for habitat, i.e.
  the resource-based habitat concept (RBHC), can solve these issues. The RBHC offers
  a framework to identify systematically the different ecological resources that are
  necessary for the completion of the transmission cycle and to relate these resources
  to (combinations of) landscape features and other environmental factors. The potential
  of the RBHC as a framework for identifying suitable habitats for vector-borne pathogens
  is explored and illustrated with the case of bluetongue virus, a midge-transmitted
  virus affecting ruminants. The concept facilitates the study of functional habitats
  of the interacting species (vectors as well as hosts) and provides new insight into
  spatial and temporal variation in transmission opportunities and exposure that ultimately
  determine disease risks. It may help to identify knowledge gaps and control options
  arising from changes in the spatial configuration of key resources across the landscape.
  The RBHC framework may act as a bridge between existing mechanistic and statistical
  modelling approaches.'
